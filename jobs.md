# Jobs at CrankWheel

CrankWheel is building screen sharing and real-time communication software that is tailor-made for telesales.

We are a remote-first company, with team members across three continents. We offer flexible hours, a worth-while mission that leaves our planet in a better state by reducing the impact of sales on our environment, competitive benefits, and a professional yet fun team spirit.

Different from a lot of "startups" out there, we are a profitable, bootstrapped company, growing at a nice pace but not some kind of VC fuelled "world domination or death" rocketship. We have a long-term focus on efficiency and quality instead of the traditional constant "hair on fire" mode of many tech companies. Longevity is the name of the game, and creating an environment where we can all do the best work of our lives without burning out.

We are currently looking to fill the following roles. Please send all inquiries to [jobs@crankwheel.com](mailto:jobs@crankwheel.com).

## Full-stack Elixir/Erlang/JavaScript developer

We are looking for a full-stack developer to join our small team and make a big impact. You can be fully remote, located anywhere in the world, although our preference is +/- 4 hours from UTC, to ensure overlap with other team members. We can also offer an on-site position in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland.

Our back-end is based on Erlang, Elixir and PostgreSQL, hosted at AWS.

Our front-end is mostly-vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, both traditional web pages and browser extensions. We also have an optional native download to enable remote control; our current version is for Win32, written in C++, and we will likely add a macOS port of this soon.

We make use of WebRTC for video capture and real-time streaming, but we also have our own proprietary video streaming implementation to ensure compatibility with a much-wider range of browsers than WebRTC does. This is important for the telesales use-case because salespeople will not use tools that have even a 1% chance of failing or creating a poor experience for the folks they are trying to sell.

If you have a few years or more experience, and are fluent in many of the technologies we use, and would like to join a small, creative, professional, remote-first team, we'd love to hear from you.
