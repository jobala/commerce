## Using the preview window to monitor engagement {#monitor-engagement}

During a screen sharing session, you might notice a small preview window that shows what you are sharing. This window shows you what the viewer is seeing. The preview window allows you to monitor if and where your viewer is engaging with your content.

![monitor-engagement1](/static/images/monitor-engagement1.png)

Above is the preview window. In this instance, the viewer is viewing on a mobile phone; the yellow frame shows you where the viewer is zooming in and the yellow spot shows where the viewer is engaging with the content.

If you hover over the preview window, you will see the connection your viewer has and the framerate of the session.

## Using the webcam {#webcam}

To turn the webcam on during sessions, click the Webcam banner which is placed between the preview window and the Program Window / Full-Screen tiles. The webcam can pop up in a small box during screen sharing or it can be used exclusively. CrankWheel does not request webcam access on the viewer side.

## Recording screen sharing sessions {#record}

With CrankWheel you can optionally[ record screen sharing sessions](https://crankwheel.com/screen-recorder/). Our users use the record function to keep the records for compliance reasons, customer success agents use it to share with customers after sessions and sales agents use it to record elevator pitches before reaching out to leads.

Recordings are uploaded to the cloud and can be downloaded locally or shared with a link.

You will have to enable the feature in the Options menu and then you are good to go by hitting rec. The full instructions are in the video below.

## Using Remote Control for engagement and interactivity {#remote-control}

With Remote Control, you can grant control to the viewer when you share a browser tab or the full screen in full security, making the session more interactive. Here is a brief instruction on how you can enable the feature:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBVWYK5DE5g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We also have a separate page that provides a [guide for how to install and use Remote Control](/remote-control-guide/).

## Instant Demos: How to connect instantly with inbound leads {#demos}

Imagine this. A customer is viewing your website or landing page. There is a “Contact Us” or “Request a demo” call to action button. The interested prospect clicks the button and enters basic information into a form that appeared. Once the prospect submits the form, you and/or your team gets an alert of a request in CrankWheel.

An eager salesperson will jump on the lead and call while the prospect is still viewing the information that created interest in your product or service. Third-party research indicates that you are 21x faster to qualify prospects by calling them quickly.

You are able to do this with the Instant Demo feature in CrankWheel. You will just need to place a code snippet on your site and you are good to go. You can find your snippet by going to your dashboard either through Options -> Admin or click [here to access your dashboard](https://meeting.is/ss/) and then click Instant Demos on the sidebar menu on the left.

If you are using WordPress, add the CrankWheel plugin to activate the widget through the sidebar menu of your admin dashboard or get it in the [Wordpress plugin site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/crankwheel/).

You can also capture leads through your social media channels or newsletter call-to-action buttons. Simply place your Instant Demos URL as the destination for the click. If you add UTM parameters, your sales team will see what spurred the interest from the lead.

See how Instant demos appear for both the presenter and the viewer:
