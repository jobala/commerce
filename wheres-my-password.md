# Where do I enter my password or log in using my social account?

CrankWheel uses one-time passwords (PIN numbers) for log-in. This means that you log in using a different mechanism than you might be used to, but don't worry, it's easy.

Instead of providing an email and password to log into CrankWheel, or logging
in using a social account such as Facebook or Google, you log in as
follows:

1. Enter your email address when prompted
2. We will send a one-time PIN number to the email address you provided
3. When the email arrives, enter the PIN number where prompted
4. You will now stay logged in for the next 30 days in your current browser

Our one-time passwords are cryptographically generated and just as secure as using a user-name and password, but more convenient as you don't need to remember a password for our service.

## How do I sign up?

If you prefer to sign up for a new account rather than logging in to an existing account, simply enter a new email address
that you haven't already used with CrankWheel when prompted to enter your email
to use CrankWheel.

## Can I set a normal password?

If you'd prefer to have a permanent PIN for logging in, you can email [support@crankwheel.com](mailto:support@crankwheel.com) and request a permanent PIN. This works similarly to a normal password, in that you will be able to log in without waiting for our verification email each time, and you can have your browser or password manager save the permanent PIN.

## Need help?

If you have any questions, or if you do not receive the email with your PIN number, or you need any other assistance getting logged in to your account or signing up for a new account, don't hesitate to contact our customer support by emailing [support@crankwheel.com](mailto:support@crankwheel.com).
