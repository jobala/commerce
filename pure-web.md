# CrankWheel requires no install, but is enhanced by our browser extension

Welcome! If you're reading this, you're likely using CrankWheel without our optional browser extension.

If you would like to enhance your experience by installing our extension, this is easy to do.
  * If you are using a Microsoft Edge browser, [click here to install](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bjpnbepckcncaideamdakikaaofkjmab) and then click the "Get" button and confirm.
  * If you are using Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave or another Chromium-derived browser, [click here to install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crankwheel-screen-sharing/dooinopjfnhlmmdkdepajfipfhlcmjgp) and then click the "Add to Chrome" button and confirm.

Without the extension, you still get almost all of our features, with three main exceptions:
  * There are some user-interface differences, a few things you may be used to if you've used the extension-based version of CrankWheel before, that are slightly different or less convenient when you have not installed our browser extension. For example, there is no button added to your browser window to launch CrankWheel (although you can add our [bookmarklet](https://meeting.is/ss/bookmarklet) for a simpler type of button).
  * Our ["cropping hints" mechanism](/api/) (used by some advanced customers) is not enabled without our browser extension.
  * Our "audit logging" mechanism, used by some enterprise customers, is not enabled without our browser extension.

There are some prompts from the browser for permissions you need to give, that you may miss the first time around if you're not careful:
  * When clicking on "Open CrankWheel Control Panel" there might be a prompt saying pop-ups were blocked for the site. You need to allow pop-ups from our site.
  * Soon after the CrankWheel control panel pops up, it will request permission to show notifications, if
	  you haven't already either granted or denied this request. Notifications are used to help you stay
		informed of actions happening within meetings, and to notify you of Instant Demo requests. They are optional
  	but recommended.
  * When you screen share for the first time, if you haven't already granted your browser access to screen recording
	  at the operating system level, it is possible your browser will show a prompt asking for access. Please grant
		this access.
  * Each time you screen share, you need to choose what to share from a list of your screens and applications.
  * When you start recording a screen sharing session, your browser may prompt you to ask if you want to allow access 
	  to your microphone. If you would like to record audio, you should allow this access, and you may wish to ask your
		browser to remember your choice.
  * The first time a recorded session ends, your browser may show a warning at the top of the CrankWheel control 
	  panel, saying something like "Your browser prevented this site from opening a pop-up window." In most browsers 
		you can click to see preferences right next to that prompt, in which you need to allow all pop-ups for our site, 
		otherwise our recording preview window will not be able to open.
  * When using [Remote Control](/remote-control/) (available only for presenters using Microsoft Windows), there are
	  also occasions where you may need to allow our site to show pop-up windows; follow the instructions in the
		previous bullet.
