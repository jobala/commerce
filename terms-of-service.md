Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.

**By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. Your usage limits depend on your selected plan, free or paid, with plan limits defined on our [pricing page](/pricing/). If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.**

**Content**

You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.

**Accounts**

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
