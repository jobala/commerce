## Frequently asked questions about Medicare and Medicare Advantage {#fre}

### What is Medicare Advantage? {#wha}

Medicare Advantage is a type of health insurance plan offered by private insurance companies that contracts with Medicare to provide Medicare benefits to beneficiaries.

Plans for Medicare Advantage plans serve as an alternative to traditional Medicare and are designed to provide additional benefits and services beyond what is covered by them.

Beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Advantage plans receive their Medicare benefits through the private insurance company, rather than directly through Medicare.

These plans often include additional benefits, such as prescription drug coverage, vision and dental coverage, and wellness programs, that are not covered by traditional Medicare.

Medicare Advantage plans also typically offer a network of providers, and beneficiaries must receive their care from providers within the network.

Some plans may also offer additional cost-sharing options, such as copays or coinsurance, to help offset the cost of healthcare services.

### What is Medicare Supplement? {#what}

Medicare Supplement (also known as Medigap) is a type of insurance policy that is designed to supplement traditional Medicare coverage.

These policies are offered by private insurance companies and are designed to help cover some of the gaps in coverage that traditional Medicare does not cover, such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.

Medicare Supplement policies are standardized and are identified by letter, such as Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, etc. Each standardized Medicare Supplement policy offers a specific set of benefits and is standardized across insurance companies. This means that a Plan A policy offered by one insurance company must provide the same benefits as a Plan A policy offered by another company.

Beneficiaries who have traditional Medicare and enroll in a Medicare Supplement policy pay a separate monthly premium for the supplement coverage, in addition to their Medicare Part B premium.

Overall, Medicare Supplement policies can help beneficiaries to manage their healthcare costs by covering some of the costs that are not covered by traditional Medicare, such as deductibles and coinsurance. This can help beneficiaries to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare services.

**Note**: Medicare Supplement policies may also have higher premiums compared to traditional Medicare and may have restrictions on provider choice.

### Comparison between Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare Supplements {#com}

Although you might enroll your customers in Medicare plans and are both [selling Medicare Supplements](https://crankwheel.com/the-winning-tactics-of-selling-medicare-supplement-plans/) and Advantage plans, you should be able to explain the difference between the three for your prospects.

Here's a table that can help you explain and compare the difference during the sales call:

| Feature | Medicare | Medicare Advantage | Medicare Supplements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage | Hospital (Part A) and medical (Part B) insurance | Hospital (Part A) and medical (Part B) insurance with additional benefits and services | Supplement to traditional Medicare coverage |
| Provider choice | Any healthcare provider who accepts Medicare | Typically limited to a network of providers | No restrictions on provider choice |
| Cost sharing | High out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, copays, and coinsurance | Typically lower out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, copays, and coinsurance | Helps cover some of the gaps in traditional Medicare coverage |
| Premiums | Monthly premium for Part B coverage | Monthly premium for Part A and Part B coverage, as well as any additional benefits and services | Separate monthly premium for supplement coverage |
| Provider reimbursement | Pays healthcare providers directly for covered services | Pays healthcare providers through a contracted rate | No effect on provider reimbursement |
| Additional benefits | Limited additional benefits, such as prescription drug coverage | Often includes additional benefits, such as prescription drug coverage, vision and dental coverage, and wellness programs | No additional benefits |

It's important to note that each Medicare plan has its own benefits, costs, and restrictions, and the best choice for a beneficiary will depend on their individual healthcare needs and preferences.

### Is It Legal to Sell Medicare Advantage over the Phone? {#isit}

Yes, it is allowed to sell Medicare Advantage over the phone. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates the sale of Medicare Advantage plans and sets rules and standards for enrolling in these plans.

As long as the sales process is compliant with CMS regulations and guidelines, Medicare Advantage plans can be sold over the phone. This includes requirements for data privacy and security and ensuring that customers receive all necessary information about the plan before enrolling.

### Do you need a special license to sell Medicare Advantage? {#doyou}

Yes, you do need a special license to sell Medicare Advantage. In order to become a Medicare Advantage sales agent, you must obtain a special license from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This license is known as the CMS Producer Number (CMS-P). In order to obtain the CMS-P license, you must complete a background check, complete a Medicare Advantage Sales Agent Training program, and pass a state exam

### Who is eligible for Medicare Advantage? {#who}

Medicare Advantage plans are available to anyone who is enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, also known as Original Medicare.

Original Medicare is a health insurance program administered by the federal government. It is composed of two parts:

* Part A (Hospital Insurance) covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health care.
* Part B (Medical Insurance) covers certain doctor services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services.

This program is available to most individuals who are 65 years or older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities and those with End-Stage Renal Disease. In some cases, individuals may need to apply for additional financial assistance to help cover the costs if this coverage is not enough. For those who need extra help, writing a [financial aid appeal letter](https://www.mos.com/blog/financial-aid-appeal-letter/) is one way to make their case for additional funding.

Enrollment periods for Medicare Advantage plans are determined by the insurance companies that offer them.

### Annual Enrollment Period for Medicare Advantage {#ann}

_The Annual Enrollment Period is between October 15th to December 7th._ This period gives beneficiaries the chance to pick a new advantage plan, change their current one or change their Medicare Part D plan.

### Open Enrollment Period for Medicare Advantage {#ope}

_This period runs from January 1st to March 31st of each year._

It gives beneficiaries the option to make changes to their plans, even the ones they signed up for during the Annual Enrollment Period. During the OEP, they can switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another. They can also switch from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan or vice versa.

Making changes during OEP can save them money on their healthcare costs and get the coverage they need.

During the OEP, you as a Medicare Agent, can review their current plans and help them compare them to other plans available. This will help them decide if they need to make any changes to ensure they are getting the best coverage for their needs.

Outside of the annual open enrollment period, people over 65 may also be able to join a Medicare Advantage plan during certain special enrollment periods. This could include if they move to an area where different plans are available, lose coverage from an employer or union, or are no longer eligible for Medicaid.

It is important to note that Medicare Advantage plans may have limited enrollment periods and that the availability of plans changes from year to year.

Therefore, it is important for people to get help in reviewing their options each year during the annual open enrollment period. That’s where you as a Medicare Agent come to the picture.

### How much money can you make selling Medicare Advantage {#howm}

There are many different commission structures for Medicare Advantage sales agents. The structure of the sales commission typically depends on the company and the individual agent. Generally, sales agents receive a base commission, which is a fixed amount for each sale, plus a bonus or incentive.

The base commission is usually a percentage of the premium charged for the sale. This percentage can range from 5% to 15% and is typically based on the size of the policy and the amount of time the agent has been selling the product. The higher the base commission, the more money an agent can make on each sale.

In addition to the base commission, sales agents may also receive bonuses or incentives. These can include bonuses for meeting certain sales quotas, meeting a certain number of sales in a certain period of time, or selling a certain number of policies. Bonuses can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the company and the individual agent.

Some companies may offer a residual commission, which is a commission paid on a monthly or annual basis for each policy sold. This commission is typically a percentage of the renewal premium. This commission is paid out as long as the policy remains in force.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, selling Medicare Advantage over the phone benefits every stakeholder by providing a convenient and efficient option for customers to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan.

By reaching a larger audience and providing personal interaction, sales agents have the opportunity to build rapport and address any concerns prospective customers may have. With the proper training and adherence to regulations, selling Medicare Advantage over the phone can provide a win-win situation for everyone involved.

For customers, purchasing a Medicare Advantage plan over the phone is accessible and saves time compared to visiting a physical location. Additionally, the sales process can be more cost-effective for both the sales agent and the insurance company.
