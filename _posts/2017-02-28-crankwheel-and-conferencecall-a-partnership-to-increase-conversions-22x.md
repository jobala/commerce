Responding to a customer request within 1 minute [increases conversion effectiveness 22x](http://www.leadresponsemanagement.org/lrm_study). It’s so intuitive yet at the same time we, the software industry, make customers jump through hoops to get our attention. Here’s one way to make that problem go away.

# A match made in sales heaven
