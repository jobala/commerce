While this podcast is not strictly aimed at just sales professionals, it offers guidance on self-improvement and motivation that are just as relevant to those working in sales as anybody else.

With a focus on personal as well as professional development, hosts Kevin Miller and Tom Ziglar discuss a variety of fascinating topics such as making goals, how to do your best and most fulfilling work, and how to have more control over your thoughts. Some episodes do veer more directly into sales, and while those episodes are obviously gold for any sales professional, make sure to tune in to the self-improvement episodes, too; after all, your mindset can have a hugely influential impact on how you act, which in turn can affect your ability to excel in sales.

If you feel as though you’ve got to grips with the technical part of sales but there’s still something missing, have a listen to a few episodes of this podcast. Perhaps what you’re lacking is inspiration, motivation, and self-belief, which this podcast is able to generate in droves.
