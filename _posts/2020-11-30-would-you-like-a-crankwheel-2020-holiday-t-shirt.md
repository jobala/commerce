Every year, we have a custom designed CrankWheel t-shirt made for the holidays. This year, we think we have a great one.

If you're on our mailing list, then you're in luck - **we will pick 50 subscribers at random this Saturday morning** (December 5th, 2020) from those who have either subscribed on or after November 1st, or opened any of our newsletters in the preceding 3 months.

If you'd like to **guarantee yourself a t-shirt**, you can do so by being one of the first 100 to leave us a video testimonial. To do that, click below and you'll be able to record right from your browser (even on your mobile device).
