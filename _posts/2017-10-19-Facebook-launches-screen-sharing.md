Facebook launches [screen sharing](https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/10/17/facebook-live-screen-sharing-feature/), slowly but surely becoming a business platform

First [Facebook quietly added workplace chat apps and screen sharing](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/facebook-screen-sharing/). Then they started experimenting with [CVs and Resumes](http://mashable.com/2017/10/16/facebook-resume-testing/#qAoOrPINsaq8), trying to compete with LinkedIN for the professional audience. Now they’re adding a screen share feature to the streaming platform Facebook Live. What does this mean for business users and why should you care?

## Screen sharing is becoming a universal necessity

Being able to display the content of one’s screen on any device in the world is a convenience that the global social network is bringing to both consumers and business users.

Workplace, Facebook’s counterpart to Slack,    now has the ability to [screen share ](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/)between users. It seems that screen sharing has become an essential tool for collaborative, internal chat apps for professional teams.

Facebook Live also seems to be getting traction with business users. Live streaming is by far one of the [coolest ways to provide valuable content for enterprising audiences](https://www.facebook.com/crankwheel/videos/1042867625818197/).

## How is Facebook’s screen sharing different from CrankWheel’s solution for business?

Productivity apps can’t really compare as this s a different beast.
