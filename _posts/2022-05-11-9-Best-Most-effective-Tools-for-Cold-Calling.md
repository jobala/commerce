Cold calling is a numbers game. Even if you have done your homework, have a list of somewhat qualified leads and start dialing full of optimism, you will get rejected. And you will get rejected a lot. Most of the time, you will be calling at the wrong time.

Cold calling success comes down to optimism and patience. In fact, to get the yes at the end of the call, you will have to stay persistent and provide real value to the prospect.

Furthermore, to be able to fill your quota, you will have to be as efficient and effective as possible.

Scheduling platforms make it easier for you to manage your schedule and appointments and give you a better overview of your busy days. There are multiple scheduling tools or suites available as well as niche products that focus on a specific angle of scheduling needs.

### Why is it important for Cold Calling?

Scheduling tools are not going to save you when you make first cold contact with a prospect. But they can help you become more efficient. They give you an overview of the day and can work both as a task list for the day or help you set up appointments or follow-ups more efficiently.

### **Recommended tool:** Calendly {#calendly}

[Calendly](https://calendly.com) is a niche tool that makes appointment setting so much easier. You send a link to your calendly page and the person you are setting up an appointment with selects available time. Calendly then syncs the appointment with both your calendar apps.

Screen sharing, as it suggests, enables you to share your screen with prospects. There are multiple options available, ranging from using specific [screen sharing tools](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/) to using screen sharing features in collaboration platforms.

### Why is it important for cold calling?

Screen sharing is important to break the ice and make your pitch visual, especially for more complex products such as insurance or digital products. Picture is worth a thousand words and by using visuals during cold calls, your prospect is more likely to understand visuals than just words.

### **Recommended tool:** CrankWheel {#crankwheel}

### Why is it important for Cold Calling?

Some more advanced conversation intelligence platforms even have the option to give you hints and advice during the conversation.

### **Recommended tool:** Rafiki {#rafiki}

Rafiki helps you by spotting deal risks and upside opportunities. It can also help in improving sales conversations. The software records and transcribes conversations and provides an analysis of them.

## **8. CRM software** {#CRM}

### What is a CRM system?

In essence, Customer Relationship Management software gives you an overview of your relationship with your customers. It stores contact information but also when and how you have interacted with the customer as well as information on when itâ€™s best to contact them and other things your sales team has noted during interactions.

### Why is it important for cold calling?

Cold calling can often be about qualifying leads which means that the agent needs to be effective in making as many calls as possible. CRM helps agents to be organized and effective. CRM is most beneficial after the first cold call, to build and nurture the relationship.

### **Recommended tool:** Freshsales {#freshsales}

[Freshsales](https://freshsales.io) enables you to manage your relations with existing and potential customers. It includes sales lead tracking, sales management, tracking events and more. You can send personalized bulk emails and activities of the emails.

    		<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#000000">Freshsales offers foundational relationship management features and customization for call centers &mdash; you can tailor visual pipelines, reports, and follow-up activities according to your needs.

## **9. Predictive Dialer** {#predictive}

### What is a predictive dialer?

A predictive dialer works in a similar way as an automatic dialer; dialing automatically from a list of prospects and routing the call to an agent when someone picks up. The difference between predictive and automatic dialers is that predictive dialers dial when itâ€™s likely that an agent will be available when the call is connected to the prospect. When the sales team has many ongoing conversations, the system slows down and picks up again when the team is available.

### Why is it important for cold calling?

Again, cold calling is a numbers game. Itâ€™s important for agents to make as many calls as possible. With a predictive dialer, you are not risking that a prospect picks up and has to wait on the line for an agent to pick up.

### **Recommended tool:** RingDNA {#ringdna}

[RingDNA](https://www.revenue.io/predictive-dialer-for-salesforce) imports data from your contacts and calls prospects from their own area code. They claim that leads are 400% more likely to pick up the phone when they see a local number dialing them.
