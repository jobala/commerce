### 3. Create the Right Content Mix to Increase Awareness

{:#contentmix}

The one thing you should never be on social media is boring. Social media users love fresh, informative, and valuable information that is delivered in a fun and enjoyable way, so you need to make sure your content ticks all the right boxes.

It may take a while for you to find the right content mix, but you can get started with these popular content types:

Think out of the box to present your solar energy-related concepts, case studies, products, etc. in a way that excites people.

### 4. Leverage the Power of Influencers

{:#influencers}

Not sure if influencer marketing will work for your solar business or not?

In a survey conducted by Influencer Marketing Hub, a whopping 90% of respondents said that influencer marketing is effective.

![influencer marketing in solar](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/02Yx1Vq32J_3wkTk1_yMzNZ6Uuy7l6GozcTDiHMvqlG3QDpwDqp5cGGF9uxEJ6Td6gCISnA6GfQ74EAbz4NSwCfnXQfjKx4lM66LNjZctIRaeAK-aBn2lG6aADrynajLCb2lxGpx2tsxdB9WN7svu6KWhMnESzPNRWCw2RkO0txIieniT_ICFwdtxeWfaA)

Image via [Influencer Marketing Hub](https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2021/)

When strategized well, influencer marketing can play an important role in helping you to generate fresh leads from different social media chanels.

Why does influencer marketing work?

Because a majority of influencers are everyday people who have risen to be authoritative voices on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

They are genuine, trustworthy, and operate in a particular niche. Over a period of time, they have garnered a huge volume of loyal followers who trust the influencer’s recommendations more than branded content.

You can leverage the power of influencer marketing by collaborating with [top micro-influencers](https://gethypedmedia.com/top-micro-influencers-on-instagram/amp/) (10K-100K followers) advocating an eco-friendly lifestyle, clean energy, and living in harmony with nature.

They can make a video to build awareness about your brand, promote your products, run contests, and even engage with your audience. This can build your brand reputation and even generate leads and grow your sales.

### 5. Establish Social Proof

{:#socialproof}

When it comes to purchasing a new product, buyers tend to look at the experience of past buyers with the product too.

As a brand that is looking to use social media, establishing social proof is essential. The power of word-of-mouth is immense and it can help you generate high-quality leads.

One of the best ways to establish social proof is by sharing customer testimonial videos and reviews from happy customers. These come across as authentic as they’re coming right from the customers.

You can request your existing customers to share their reviews on their social media profiles and tag you. These [social media feedback](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/social-media-feedback/) posts can be reshared on your profile to build your reputation and drive sales for your solar business.

What’s more?

You can also add social proof to your landing pages by collecting testimonials from social media using a tool. These can help boost your conversions too.

### 6. Provide Great Customer Service

{:#customerservice}

Social media is not only a platform to promote your solar products, but it can also be used to provide great [customer service](https://crankwheel.com/5-principles-of-great-customer-service/). Doing so strategically can also help you attract new clients.

Modern-day customers regularly reach out to brands on social media for any concerns that they have, and they expect quick responses.

So, if you want to impress your prospects and existing clients, a timely and satisfying response is what you need to deliver. You can start by deploying [best AI chatbots](https://attrock.com/blog/best-ai-chatbots/) to answer your customer queries instantly. And to support chatbots, you can even have agents.

The key is to respond to any post by a customer and then take the conversation away from the public eye.

Let’s say a user comments on your post with a query or seeks more details about solar panel installation changes. You can request them to connect with you on Facebook Messenger and take the conversation forward there.

This is especially important when you’re dealing with angry or frustrated customers. Having the conversation in public might get potential customers to turn away.

### 7. Join Niche Groups

{:#nichegroups}

When you want to use social media for selling your solar products, you need to have both short-term and long-term plans.

For instance, social media ads may generate some quick leads, but being a part of a community will help you stay in the competition in the longer run.

Facebook has several communities that talk about alternative energy, green energy, environmental awareness, and several other topics that you can relate to.

![selling solar on facebook](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9yfaX3WNEcJ3cyjPJfRqtQfDqbqHOWKD4PBNkA2z8kuR7M8KYY7LE3vbRFlUEkAE9rqfaJMIef8eaZr58c-Ht2MSM1sKaxi8Nv5P_zsNtS7NTlnkJT6msGeFXRMvxMuJyE1rwYjGvsn48tUwNEBc8waY8JqBquT27bDP9mXq1s5mpa5HpLvGSvUyf6G0_g)

Image via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=green%20energy)

You can sift through a long list of public and private groups and find the ones that are most relevant to you. The main intention here is to build a community and establish yourself as a brand that cares for the environment.

The advantages of joining such niche groups are plenty. First of all, this is where your target audience is. When they discuss a variety of issues, you get to understand their pain points, and expectations from a solar brand like yours, and understand what is the best way to serve them.

You can even create your community from scratch to establish your brand as an authority figure in the industry.

### 8. Analyze Your Competitors’ Marketing Strategies

{:#analyzestrategies}

It goes without saying that we operate in a highly competitive digital market. Your competitors are working equally hard to generate a huge amount of leads and grow their businesses.

If there is something your competitors are doing exceptionally well, don’t hesitate to draw inspiration from them. Competitor analysis is absolutely vital.

While you don’t want to copy what your competitors are doing, there are several things you can learn from them. Find out what kind of activities they are doing on social media. How are they driving engagement? And how is your target audience responding to your competitors’ campaigns?

A comprehensive competitor analysis will give you insights into what you can do differently to engage with your target audience more effectively and improve your sales.

What’s more?

When you employ any of your competitors’ strategies, you can leverage sales platforms to figure out if they’re working for you or not. Based on that, you can tweak them up.

### 9. Encourage Employee Advocacy on Social Media

{:#employeeadvocacy}

Your employees are a great asset for you to build your brand reputation on social media. Go ahead and build a strong employee advocacy program where your employees and associates can promote your brand and products.

It is a great way to market your business, amplify your reach organically and generate high-converting leads.

Your employees can share your posts, write about you on their personal page and in relevant groups, and they can even send direct messages to their connections about your solar offering

They serve as internal influencers from your organization and even help in humanizing your brand.

To maintain brand voice, you can provide certain guidelines and templates for your employees to work with. Based on these, they can craft content in their own style and drive engagement for you.
