As an insurance agent, setting goals can help you get clear visions of what you want to achieve throughout the year. It also helps you to plan and track your performance by setting a clear path ahead. So you can see your achievements and give yourself enough pats on the back by the end of the year.

However, setting goals is not about jotting down your future achievements. If you want to make them practicable, there is no better way than to create smart goals.

Smart goals require you to take measurable steps and incorporate new approaches in setting accomplishments. For instance, you want to use [AI content marketing tools](https://breadnbeyond.com/artificial-intelligence/content-marketing-tools/) to help you stay productive.

## What are SMART Goals? {#smartgoals}

Smart is the abbreviation of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely. Taking into account the five factors, you can make a wiser decision on deciding what goals to target, why you need them, and how you execute them.

If you haven’t heard about smart goals, it can be daunting for you to take further steps. To give you a more in-depth look at smart goals, we’ve prepared the elaboration of each criterion below.

### Specific

Your goals need to be specific. The more specific they are, the easier it is for you to meet them. On the contrary, a goal that is too broad can be challenging to make true.

**When specifying your goal, try to answer the five questions below**.

1. **What goal do I want to realize?**
2. **Why is the goal significant?**
3. **Who will be involved?**
4. **How will I execute the goal?**
5. **What obstacles or external factors may come along the way?**

For instance, you want to improve your marketing strategy. Having such a goal is great, but you can make it more specific, like you want to change your strategy into video marketing to pull in clients.

From there, you can answer the five questions above. Why do you think video marketing will be a good approach? Do you need other parties to create videos? How to make your video highly converting? And what problems may arise?

### Measurable

Your goals must be measurable. Whether you want to measure manually or use digital tools, ensure you can see your progress from time to time. When measuring progress, you can focus on answering _“how many”_ or _“how much”_ questions.

You can set monthly or weekly measurements. For example, you want to submit 16 applications in a month. You can break it down into four applications per week. This way, your workload becomes more manageable, and you can track progress easier.

### Achievable

You’re the one who can value whether or not your goals are achievable. Consider your capabilities, resources, and last year’s performance to come up with ideal targets.

For example, you can check your last year’s performance to set a realistic goal for the number of applicants. You can raise the number adequately to avoid burnout.

### Relevant

Your yearly goals should be relevant to your career path or personal growth. You can set a list of targets like submitting more applicants, building loyal clients, or getting professional certifications.

However, you should also think about your personal growth. Think of how to make you grow to be a better person. You can wish to improve your [insurance selling skills](https://crankwheel.com/the-top-9-insurance-selling-skills-you-need-to-know/), communication skills, or as simple as maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

### Timely

It’s important to make your goals timely. One way to make your goals lifely is by creating a start and end date for your goals. Setting time frames or deadlines can help you stay on track and focus on making progress.

You can also set deadlines to evoke the spirit or maintain your motivation to do your job. For example, you want to buy a printer this month and a working table next month.

Your intention is to make your goals relevant and achievable. Breaking down your goals into time frames can make them realistically reachable and less daunting.

## How to Set SMART Goals? {#setsmartgoals}

As there are a few aspects to consider, setting smart goals for 2023 can be daunting for anyone. Without knowing how to do it properly, creating your smart goal list can take forever.

But don’t be worried. We understand the struggle to come up with smart goals. So we’ve pieced together practical steps to set your smart goals as an insurance agent in 2023. Keep scrolling!

### 1. Begin with Self-Reflection

Self-reflection can help you decide what goals you should achieve this year. You can check your performance by revisiting your past goals and whether or not you’ve accomplished them.

You can find out which goals haven’t been completed or which ones you successfully managed. Take a tour of your memory line to find out which strategies you couldn’t pull off and what approaches helped you succeed.

For the accomplished goals, you can continue them by increasing the quantity or quality. As for the ones you haven’t been able to complete, you can seek better resources or approaches to solving them.

### 2. Break Down Big Dreams

Again, big goals take a lot of work to handle, so always make your goals specific. A goal that is too broad will confuse you. You may need help finding strategies, resources, and solutions to accomplish it.

On the flip side, specific goals are easier to handle. As you know the ways to meet them, you won’t neglect other goals on your list. This way, your goals become more manageable and achievable. You might want to dig into [Social Media Marketing for Insurance Agents](https://crankwheel.com/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-social-media-marketing-for-insurance-agents/) but should be more specific by doing [Instagram Marketing as an Insurance Agent](https://crankwheel.com/instagram-marketing-for-insurance-agents-an-all-in-one-guide-to-get-started/).

### 3. Plan for New Approaches

As you develop new ideas and goals, you should also incorporate new approaches to improve your professional career. You can ask your seniors or colleagues to achieve certain targets or handle specific problems.

You may also consider improving your quality as an [insurance agent](https://crankwheel.com/ppc-marketing-for-insurance-agents/) by joining a webinar or online training. You can get many valuable insights as well as new connections. Moreover, you can get help from experts or professionals in the forum.

### 4. Start with “Why?”

You’re most likely already knowing what your next targets are. However, finding the motivation to make plans and execute them is another problem. It’s part of self-reflection that can help you get a clearer vision of what’s ahead.

If the doubt strikes in, start questioning the “why” to yourself. “Why is this goal significant to you? “Why do you need a new approach to meet your target?” and other questions. You will find reasons to keep working on your goals.

### 5. Be Realistic

Being realistic about your goals is important. It is in line with making your goals specific and not too broad. If you have target numbers along with your goals, make them adequately, so you have a better chance of achieving them.

Furthermore, if you want to improve the quality of specific jobs, you may need the proper equipment to support you. So having a good balance between goals and reality is paramount to maintaining your motivation.

### 6. Create a Custom Calendar

One way to help you stay on track and keep progressing is by setting a timeline. You can create a custom calendar with your goals and targets throughout the year.

It allows you to monitor your performance easily. You can notice whenever you struggle to accomplish certain targets and make immediate adjustments if necessary.

### 7. Be Flexible in Adjusting and Reset

Continuing the previous point, adjustments are most likely needed along the journey. You can’t be stubborn over your goals because it will only hurt you.

If you struggle to achieve certain goals for a long time, there must be issues. Your job is to find the problem and seek solutions to help you proceed.

Moreover, never blame yourself for not getting close to your goals. In a list of goals you made, some are meant to be checked, and others you can save for next year’s resolution.

The thing is, if you think you need to reset your goals, then don’t be stressed too much over it. You may need some time to rest and get back on track stronger.
