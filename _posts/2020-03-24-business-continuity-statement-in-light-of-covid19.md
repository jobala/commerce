In light of COVID-19, we want you to know that you can rest assured that
CrankWheel as a company is in excellent shape. We will continue to operate, and
improve our product and service, throughout the crisis.

We perform a company-wide risk analysis once a quarter, and have recently had an
additional such session in light of  COVID-19. We have business continuity
plans in place for all risks that we perceive as having the potential to
disrupt our business or service.

We are a profitable business and have been for a long time, operating with
positive cash flow each month.

We are seeing significantly increased inbound demand for CrankWheel now that
more and more companies are shifting their sales force to telesales or inside
sales. We have therefore taken steps to decrease various costs related to direct
sales and demand generation, and redeployed resources towards scaling up our
operational capacity to meet the increased demand, and to ensure we can
continue to make product improvements at the same time.

We are a fully remote company, and we have all been working from home since well
before the pandemic became severe in our respective countries. We are helping our
staff make sure they are prepared to work from home for a long time, in terms of
equipment and supplies so that they can be safe and comfortable with their
families.

Finally, we feel a duty to help businesses and solo practitioners around the
world keep their sales game strong through this crisis. You can count on us,
and we are always here to help, simply reach out with any questions by email
to [support@crankwheel.com](mailto:support@crankwheel.com) or through the
chat bubble on this website.
