**About CrankWheel**

CrankWheel is a bootstrapped startup, based in Iceland. It was founded in 2015 by Jói Sigurdsson and Gilsi Sigvaldason, childhood friends from Akureyri in Northern Iceland. Jói worked for 10 years at Google’s Montréal office before moving back to Iceland to found CrankWheel with Gilsi, who had a wealth of experience in sales of insurance and finance solutions. Their different backgrounds are the pillar of CrankWheel; Jói was a tech lead at Google working on technologies such as the Chrome browser and WebRTC, whereas Gilsi had on multiple occasion driven hours simply to show a customer his laptop screen. The result was an application that allows salespeople to share their screens in real-time with customers during a sales call. www.crankwheel.com
