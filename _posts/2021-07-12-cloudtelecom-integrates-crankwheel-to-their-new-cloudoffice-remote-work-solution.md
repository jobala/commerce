CloudTelecom provides a voice service called Mobabiji which enables users to make and receive company calls on their smartphones wherever they are in Japan. With the outbreak of Covid 19 and the following increase in remote work, Mobabiji customers were requesting a service that would support remote work even further. CloudTelecom started developing the CloudOffice solution and since Mobabiji is originally a telephone-based service, it was essential to include a function that would give users the ability to easily share documents while making a phone call.

The other four services in CloudOffice were developed in-house and CloudTelecom was planning a similar route with the screen-sharing service but “After trying the CrankWheel service and admiring the perfection and splendor, I immediately stopped developing it and I decided to contact CrankWheel. With the great cooperation of CrankWheel employees, it is my great pleasure to launch our "CloudOffice Console" including Crank Wheel” says CloudTelecom chairman Satoshi Nakaoka.

“We are honored that CloudTelecom chose CrankWheel as a part of their remote work solution. This collaboration further strengthens our growth in Japan.” Þorgils Sigvaldason, CrankWheel co-founder and CRO. “We let the product speak for itself and it works in any browser, any device and our global footprint show that it works in any language or culture” - Jói Sigurdsson, CrankWheel co-founder and CEO.

**About CloudTelecom:** CloudTelecom is based in Tokyo, Japan that provides telecommunication services to over 5000 SME’s in Japan.
