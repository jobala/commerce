One of the key factors, when it comes to converting a lead is taking a **custom approach**. Tailoring demos and pitches to what a potential customer actually needs. And that means putting in the work in the beginning in order to reap the benefits later.

Think of it the other way round, if you are being pitched at. If you’re sick and tired of the same cookie-cutter PDF proposals that focus on the entirely wrong thing, and demos that take too much of your time, you can imagine how the decision-makers in your target audience feel.

When you are putting the **client’s needs first,** it’s much more effective than simply pitching and hoping for the best. In this article, we look at the ways you can use Instant Demos and Better Proposals to increase conversion rates.

## Before we get started…

Let’s get back to basics. I imagine you already know what CrankWheel offers, but if not, don’t worry. CrankWheel is an easy screen sharing software that will reduce the time-to-close on cold prospects. For a more in-depth explanation, [check out this video](https://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/).

On the other hand, Better Proposals is an easy to use and optimize software tool that helps you create unique [web based business proposals](https://betterproposals.io/blog/proposal-management-software/) that are easy to sign. The two work beautifully hand in hand to help you achieve higher conversion rates. Let me show you how!

## #1 Grab their attention

When using Better Proposals, the first thing your potential client is going to see is an introduction. Now, this isn’t where you write all about your company and its history, but to summarise the main problems your potential client has, and how your solution(s) can solve them.

The trick is to **grab their attention by paying attention to them**. The reason they reached out for a proposal is that they recognized that they have a problem and they’re not sure how to solve it themselves.

Once you’ve grabbed their attention, you can save a bit of information for later, or scatter it through the proposal, just to keep them interested. Our CEO Adam said it the best in [this short clip](https://youtu.be/0hGTd-d-Hho).

The same goes for CrankWheel’s Instant Demos. Your presentation is your time to shine, so don’t avoid putting in the work. Since you’re meeting with a potential client is on-line, make the most of that situation with an [eye-catching presentation](https://crankwheel.com/creative-use-of-remote-screen-shares-to-improve-sales-conversion-rates/). Besides the demo, you should also set aside time for showcasing different testimonials or case studies and time for your client to ask questions.

## #2 Results, results, results

What are you selling? The best, most universal answer would be time. You’re selling the time it takes to finish a job or project that the potential client can use to focus on other things. These two platforms make that abundantly clear from the get go. Whether it’s Instant Demos or Better Proposals, the initial step of signing up for a free trial is easy and hassle-free.

Once you sign up, you’ll see that we both removed all unnecessary form fields and made our platforms easy to use, without any formatting or downloading necessary. The beautiful and easy to use interface of these platforms can be described as love at first sight because it’s just that easy.   
  
Better Proposals offer [proposal templates](https://betterproposals.io/free-proposal-templates) that will get you started with all the necessary steps you can easily customize to your client (in some cases, all you have to change is the name of your and your client’s business and the price).

You can also easily track how many times your client opened your proposal, and where they spend the most time, which will give you insight into which sections you need to change or bring forth. The proposals also include contacts with legally binding electronic signatures and payment options.

CrankWheel’s Instant Demos also save time and elevate your sales process. Without the need to download or install software, customers can easily take part in your presentation and see the exact thing you're talking about. This gives a new, visual dimension to your sales calls, and sets you apart from the rest.

## #3 Test everything

And I mean everything. Yes, the call IS coming from inside the house and it’s telling you to split test everything including design and content. The reason we perfected our software is that we did some split tests and saw what worked best for our clients.

President Barack Obama perfected the art of online marketing, particularly using email, in his 2008 presidential campaign. Would you be surprised to know that in Obama’s email marketing campaigns, there was a $2.2 million difference in donations [between the worst and best](https://optinmonster.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-split-testing-your-email-newsletters/) performing email subject lines? Even the smallest changes can make the biggest difference.

## #4 Track how people interact

“Turn a cold prospect into a new client” sounds like a line that should end with “Extra! Extra! Read all about it!”, right? Well, as much as sales gurus want to sell you an idea that all sales is, is in fact a natural talent, the truth is, it's a numbers game.

To get to the top, you need to know exactly why your sales approach is working and do it again and again and again. The way you get to that place is by tracking how your clients react to your pitch. Better Proposals offer an amazing integrated analytics system that lets you do just that.

Imagine needing only one sales call to secure a client. When you cut down the number of calls it takes for a client to sign on, in doing so you can focus on generating more sales. In order to achieve this, you need to create a clear proposition, meaning you need to be able to[ quickly explain](https://crankwheel.com/how-to-increase-conversion-rates-with-a-culture-of-instant-online-demos/) your service/product to people who are not as technically advanced as you are.

Just like the famous Einstein quote, you need to be able to present your pitch in a way that won’t confuse the people sitting opposite of you. In the same lane, one of the first things your clients will want to hear is the estimated ROI. If you focus on perfecting your approach to these issues, you will quickly be able to create a universal proposal/demo that you can slightly modify for future use.

With all that being said, I’ll leave you with one last question - are you ready to up your sales game and increase conversion rates? Get started with a free trial with the links below.
