“Virtual sales” has simply become the way sales are done. Inbound and outbound teams are using video platforms. Most field sales agents are still working from home and interacting with clients and prospects using CrankWheel, Zoom, and other video software tools.

There are numerous virtual sales benefits that companies are embracing, such as cost and time savings. Providing that the right tools are used in the right way to engage prospects and clients. Virtual sales calls should make the same impact as phone calls and in-person meetings, and ultimately, produce better outcomes, such as higher conversion rates.

## Virtual sales benefits

Virtual sales calls save a lot of money, especially for field sales teams. No need for fuel costs, or flights or trains to visit prospects and clients. No expenses. A laptop and Wi-Fi connection is all that’s needed. Virtual sales calls can be done with a worldwide rota of clients and prospects, without the added expense and time involved traveling to see them.

It turns out, buyers now prefer virtual sales interactions to in-person meetings.

According to a recent [Bain & Company survey](https://www.bain.com/insights/virtual-selling-has-become-simply-selling/), conducted with Dynata, a massive 92% of B2B buyers prefer virtual sales calls. That’s 17 points upon how many buyers felt about virtual sales in May 2020.

As the switch to sales video calls started as the result of the pandemic, the fact that salespeople now prefer them over traditional ways of interacting with prospects shows there is long-term demand for video in the sales mix. Although many are getting tired of some platforms, others are proving to be an integral and preferred solution for sales teams, such as dedicated screen sharing software like CrankWheel.

## Why virtual sales calls?

More importantly for sales managers, 79% of sellers (salespeople and teams) are finding virtual sales more effective than any other method. Virtual sales calls generate higher conversion rates.

This means we are very likely to see “virtual sales” become the new and ongoing normal for sales. It’s no longer separate from inbound, outbound or field. Because although inbound and outbound teams could have stuck with phone calls and emails, many went the virtual route because it made it easier to establish a human connection with clients and prospects.

Virtual sales have the advantage of being faster, easier to organise, and salespeople can connect with more prospects in the average day than in-person meetings. Especially when you factor in travel time, no matter how that travel is organized.

As far as sales figures are concerned, virtual selling is more effective. Win rates are 45% higher, and revenue per rep is 43% higher than other methods, according to a [Bain & Company survey](https://www.bain.com/insights/virtual-selling-has-become-simply-selling/).

## How to run a virtual sales meeting

Hosting a virtual sales meeting is easy. As easy as any video call or meeting with colleagues. Simply follow these three easy steps:

1. Simply send your prospect or client a link to show your availability. Various calendar solutions make this easy, and this puts the call straight in your diary, through whichever software you use for this.
2. Follow that up with a link to the virtual sales meeting.
3. If you use a solution such as CrankWheel, they don't even need to download anything and can attend the meeting on any device, from anywhere in the world, and can also dial in from a phone.

If you are already on a call with a prospect, it’s easy to transform the call into a virtual sales meeting by adding visual elements to the call with [screen sharing](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/) software.

Before any virtual meeting, make sure your microphone and camera are working. Check your background, and desktop, to make sure your virtual desk is clear. And have the relevant virtual sales enablement tools ready, such as presentations and case studies.

CrankWheel, unlike other video calling solutions, can also complement voice-based calls. Visual elements such as presentations and pitch decks and demonstrations of products can be introduced easily, while the person you are calling doesn’t need to join via a webcam. Making it easier for sales prospects to be out and about, taking your call without needing to be logged in, or download anything before the virtual sales call.

## Virtual tools for video sales calls

Although the majority of sales calls happen as outlined above, there are a number of options and tools and techniques for salespeople. When we talk about tools, that can mean platforms, such as CrankWheel. However, it can also refer to ways video calls are used.

Below are three options for sales teams:

### #1: Pre-recorded videos in cold email

What if your prospect doesn't have time for a call you’d planned?

Instead of leaving a voicemail, you could record a short personalised video clip and send them it. Aim to put across some of the key benefits, features and value of the product or service you are selling.

Even better, have a pre-recorded sales pitch-style video ready to send in emails to prospects in the sales pipeline. Better than a copy and paste sales email. Use video to your advantage.

Emails with videos in them have to have videos that appear embedded in the message, if you are simply pasting in a Youtube link, you are less likely to see results. Make sure to use services that insert an animated gif that leads customers to a landing page when clicked.

With [sales engagement videos](https://accordium.com/sales-engagement-videos/) in your emails, you are adding a personal touch to your emails and establish trust by showing a person at the other end of the message. You are more likely to get a reply when you add a short video to you emails.

### #2: Screen sharing

CrankWheel also gives salespeople the option to [screen share with prospects and sales leads](https://crankwheel.com/industries/screen-sharing-for-sales/) during phone calls. This way, you can showcase products and services more easily. Showing rather than telling is always a quicker route to success when trying to convert prospects.

### #3: E-signatures to close deals

When inbound leads are a steady part of the sales pipeline, then it’s incredibly useful to leverage [E-signatures](https://accordium.com/accordium-sign/) at the end of the sales process. With e-signatures, you don’t have to chase down signatures and risk losing the deal. You can deliver the pitch and close the sale during a virtual session, then move over to the contract while sharing your screen, send it over and have signed. All during the same meeting.

## Key Takeaways

Video calls and platforms are here to stay for sales teams. Buyers prefer this approach (92%, according to Bain & Company). So do sales teams. Video calls generate higher conversion rates; up to 45% higher (Bain & Company). As video calls save time and money, and are more convenient for both parties, they improve productivity and make the whole sales process easier for everyone.
