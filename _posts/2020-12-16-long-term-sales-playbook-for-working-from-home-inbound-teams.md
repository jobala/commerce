Before this pandemic, inbound sales teams almost always worked in the office.

Now everyone is working from home (WFH), or should be, to help prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Is this the end of the office as we know it?

With ongoing surges in cases across Europe and America, you could be forgiven for thinking life will never be the same again. However, there is now some hope, a glimmer of hope on the horizon.

Vaccine trials are apparently going well, it’s proving safe, and mass-market manufacturing could start within weeks, following regulatory approval. Countries around the world are strengthening their response and improving their preparedness. The world seems like it is moving in the right direction.

But for the foreseeable future, working from home (WFH) is the only viable and safe option for inbound sales teams. Expect this to be the case for at least 2021.

## Long-term Playbook: WFH for Inbound Sales Teams

### #1: Remember the benefits

At first, there seemed to be no upsides to working from home.

Everyone was scrambling to adapt. Schools were closed in most countries, forcing parents to juggle work and family life, and haphazard home schooling.

Not to mention the fear factor or living with a deadly pandemic, as governments struggled (some more than other) to provide appropriate responses to something no one seriously expected, or had planned for. It was crippling, at first. Since then, many people have adapted; although it’s still challenging.

When it comes to working from home, there are upsides for sales teams.

Switching to remote helps sales teams hit targets, with 64% of sales leaders hitting or exceeding target that went remote, [according to HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/growth-opportunities).

### #2: Use Video for sales calls/meetings

When it comes to sales meetings/calls, the most effective technology is video platforms, such as CrankWheel. 74% of sales leaders found that video, whether remote screen-sharing or Instant Demos, helped them hit target, according to HubSpot.

Sales teams that underperformed rarely used video, or didn't use it effectively. Video is known for being 34x more effective than phone or email, as a way of engaging with prospects.

For inbound teams, Instant Demos is a feature we know they love. Thousands of sales agents use this everyday to give demos to inbound leads. We also know that time is crucial when inbound leads come in, so don’t waste a moment to give them a demo, get to know them, build a rapport and ask smart qualifying questions.

### #3: Perfect your online presentations

Since video calls are the only way forward, you need to get awesome at them.

We’ve put together the following [3-part webinar series](https://crankwheel.com/webinar-series-going-from-field-sales-to-inside-sales/) to help inbound sales agents get used to online presentations (set aside about 1 hour 30 minutes for the whole series):

### #4: Use Automation and Sales Enablement Material

Automation and sales enablement materials make it easier for sales teams to be effective. You can do more, and sell more, when your time is spent talking to prospects instead of sending emails manually and creating sales proposals.

Automating as much of the sales process increases conversion rates. It reduces time that you need to spend on tasks that can be scheduled. Sales teams that use meeting schedule tools, quote generation, and automated content or emails, are 61% more effective than those who don’t, according to HubSpot.

Sales enablement materials, such as case studies, presentations, and proposal documents are equally essential for success. Yet again, 65% of organizations that hit or exceeded targets either had a person dedicated to this function, or worked with an external provider to create materials.

### #5: Routines are important

Before working from home (WFH) was imposed upon millions across the world, there was remote working, or telecommuting. Other ways of describing what many of us are now doing. But WFH is not remote working, at least not as it’s currently being done in the middle of a global pandemic.

Encourage your team to set and stick to routines. If they can’t go to a gym in the morning, then suggest people fit in a walk or run instead.

Encourage digital switch-off times, especially if they’re using work devices. This way, your team won’t be plugged in 24/7, helping them be more productive during working hours, while also making it easier for them to get through the challenges of a global pandemic.

Sales hasn’t changed, as such. However, the ways in which inbound teams operate has changed, which means sales leaders sticking to the following playbook:

* Know how to perfect the art of online presentations
* Use video calls for sales meetings/demos
* Make sure to use amazing presentations/visuals for every call
* Ensure everyone on the team maintains a routine
* Have regular check-in calls and team sessions
