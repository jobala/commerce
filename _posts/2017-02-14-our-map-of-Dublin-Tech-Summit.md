## Let's get informal!

We made a bet that we'll pre-sell 100 [CrankWheel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crankwheel-screen-sharing/dooinopjfnhlmmdkdepajfipfhlcmjgp) subscriptions during [Dublin Tech Summit](http://www.dublintechsummit.com). If we hit that number we're inviting all subscribers for some lovely Guinness and startup sales conversations. $123 for early access to Instant Demos can really change your perception of sales.

We’re also welcoming partnerships in both co-branded sales initiatives and content marketing campaigns.

Have ideas for some spin-off initiatives? Booth S082 is the place to be!
