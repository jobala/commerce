When it comes to capturing warm inbound sales leads these days, you are facing challenging circumstances. Everyone is. Marketers are all in the same boat. You are fighting hard to get the attention of your target audience against the distracting effect of the rest of the Internet, and dozens of competitors.

Millions of businesses have services or products that they are selling, and there is an ocean of options out there. Plus, you are fighting against numerous distractions. Trying to get the attention of your audience for just long enough for them to take an interest.

We’ve all heard the saying, “there are plenty of fish in the sea.” While our friends have shared that adage with us after tough breakups, it’s true in marketing, too. If you are not strategic in capturing leads’ attention, then someone else will do a more effective job.

Marketing strategies means that everyone is using the same type of bait, to hook the same audience and target customers. It is common knowledge that websites need blogs, quality content, guest posts and even gated content in order to capture leads.

But these are no longer enough.

Now, with all the competition, you need bait that is personalized for the specific, high-quality fish (leads) you are seeking. That’s where quiz marketing comes into the picture.

Let’s dive in.

## What is Quiz Marketing?

We have all seen the quizzes on websites such as Buzzfeed providing us with insights such as “Which Friends Character Are You?” or “What Does Your Taste In Ice Cream Say About Your Love Life?”

These quizzes are fun and tend to be a good distraction from work (you didn’t hear that from us!), but they are not the ones we want to focus on here. Instead, we are talking about [lead generation quizzes](https://surveyanyplace.com/lead-generation-quizzes/).

These interactive quizzes work to identify your audience’s needs and preferences. They also accomplish the following:

* Attract new leads, even if they are outside of your existing audiences
* Decrease your cost per lead by up to 90 percent
* Increase engagement with segmented audiences
* Qualify your various audiences (pre-qualified leads are always more effective)
* Promote relevant products and/or services
* Integrate email collection data with your marketing platforms

Now let’s dive deeper.

## How Does Quiz Marketing Support Marketing Goals?

To explain this, let’s map out the sort of scenario that is typical for marketers.

Digital marketers usually have a range of lead generation options on the websites they manage, but not all of these are effective all of the time. These methods can become a bit stale, and if potential leads are no longer biting, what are you doing to do?

### Personalization: Make People Feel Special

One big reason traditional lead generating tools are no longer working is because they are not personalized. People love when something is tailored to them. They want to feel unique and seen. If a brand treats everyone the same, then potential leads will go elsewhere to feel special.

Remember, you are trying to convince these leads that you are the best possible option for them.You need to show them that you really understand them, their wants, needs, pain points and how you can solve their problems.

This is exactly where quiz marketing can make a big difference.

When designing a quiz (which is really easy to put together), you’re going to want to use tools such as skip logic and custom scoring to make it as personalized as possible. These quizzes are your opportunity to not only learn about your audience, but for them to be excited to tell you about themselves.

### Case: A Quiz as an Email List Building Tool

Use quizzes to help segment your audience into buyer personas, [like Krister Ungerböck](https://surveyanyplace.com/quiz-marketing-case-study/), a keynote speaker, global communication expert and former CEO of a global technology company.

Once he saw the leads taking the quiz and landing on specific results, he was able to use that information to [build out email lists](https://eduardklein.com/email-marketing-services/). These lists were also personalized because the quiz showed which products would be most valuable to the specific buyer personas. Because of that, Ungerböck was able to include links in the emails that lead to products that would most benefit them.

As a result, he said his agency received a typical response rate of between 65 percent and 75 percent.

Here is another example—imagine you are a digital marketing company. If you knew a certain group in your email list was struggling with keyword research, you could [create a webinar](https://www.awesomex.com/webinar-software/) that solves some of the most common keyword related issues and send it over via email. This would be a good way of potentially capturing a lead or taking them to the next step of your [marketing funnel](https://diggitymarketing.com/digital-marketing-funnel/).

## How Do I Make a Lead Generation Quiz?

So now you want to make your own lead generation quiz—but where should you start?

Below, we have provided examples of how to make your quiz as effective as possible.

### #1: Skip Logic and Custom Scoring

These two tools are essential to lead generation quizzes because they need to be highly personalized in order to work.

Skip logic is a tool that enables quiz makers to specify the direction of the quiz. Each answer the participant submits dictates the next question. This tool ensures these quizzes do not all look the same.

Custom scoring assigns a score to each answer to help dictate the end result. For example, with these types of quizzes, the participant might receive different insights or products depending on the number they reach with their scoring.

### #2: Customize Your Quiz

Remember, with lead generation quizzes, you are trying to get the audience hooked into your business. You are quite literally selling your business to them. That means that every part of your quiz needs to reflect your business. Make sure it includes your branding, logos, voice and even company colors.

You want to make sure there is no mistaking what your potential leads are seeing in regards to your business.

### #3: Wedge Your Form: After the Questions, Before the Results

Ah, the lead generation data capture form. That magical form that gives you, as a marketer, the vital information you need in order to secure leads. The placement of this form is essential.

If you put it in front of the quiz, then participants will not, well, participate. However, if you do it after providing them with insights, then they will simply not fill it out because there is no incentive to do so.

The sweet spot for that form placement is after the quiz but before any insights are provided to the participant. Doing it this way will ensure that the form is filled with vital information because the participant just spent their time taking the quiz, so they want to see their results.

## Summary

When it comes to marketing, yes, there are many fish in the sea. However, quiz marketing will ensure that you are catching the type of leads you are targeting. That’s because they offer highly personalized experiences for your potential leads, showing them that you care about them, their needs and their business.
