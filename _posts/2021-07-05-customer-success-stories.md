## **Mortgage and insurance services.** Complimenting phone appointments with screen sharing software: Connells Group

Lockdown made face-to-face meetings with customers impossible. For Connells Group, that meant rethinking their whole approach. Their strategy was to complement phone appointments by showing presentations and calculations through screen sharing. Connells Group chose a solution that would work on any device in any browser and the customer could access without installation or registration. First tests showed that agents with screen sharing sessions outperformed others by 15-20%. With CrankWheel, they kept the pace and outperform their competitors that did not use screen sharing.

## **Tax advisory.** Capturing hot inbound leads instantly and close faster with screen sharing: Declarando

The challenge for Declarando was that the sales cycle was too long, taking at least two or more calls/demos to get an inbound or outbound lead to sign-up and start working with them. Growth was slower and attrition rates within the sales funnel higher, which means it took more time and costs more to get prospects into the funnel and convert them into clients. Declarando started using CrankWheel to give a sales lead demo quicker, thus reducing the sales cycle, thereby increasing conversion rates.
