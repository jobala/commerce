Screen sharing is a big part of the modern sales process. Inside sales teams are increasingly using screen sharing as an invaluable sales tool. Compared to in-person presentations, screen sharing needs a different approach and set of skills to engage your audience.

Sales team members with a few years experience might think they've got the skills for screen sharing. Whether in-person, doing a presentation, over the phone or screen sharing, someone with experience might assume they’ve got the right format and style for success.

But that isn’t always the case. When it comes to [screen share](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/), it’s the most difficult way - because it’s newer and not as natural and familiar as other methods - to engage an audience. Especially if you can't see them. Maybe your prospect has started clearing an inbox backlog, taken an interest in a Twitter debate, or scrolling through Instagram. If you can’t see them, can you know for certain?

## Screen sharing sales success formula

Sales is all about making revenue repeatable and reliable. That means, creating and following a formula that works for every sales prospect and account. However you’re doing sales calls, find a process that works for and stick with it.

To start with, take a look at your preparation process:

• Have you researched the client/prospect?

• Have you prepared questions to qualify the prospect? Even when a sales lead comes in hot - via an inbound enquiry - take the time to do some research and prepare the questions you need to ask.

• Have you asked how much time they have for this call? Knowing that will help you tailor the length and style of the presentation, leaving plenty of time for the prospect to talk and answer questions.

• Do you have a presentation ready? Visuals are an essential component of a screen sharing sales call. Software sales teams might want to walk them through elements of the product, whereas other sales teams would benefit from a pre-prepared presentation that can be used on sales calls. Aim to wow them visually.

• Assuming the sales prospect sounds interested - and you've been able to qualify them as a viable prospect - have a minimum set of follow-up actions and timescales agreed at the end of the call.

Next, think about your presentation skills. Experienced sales professionals might assume they've got this part down to a fine art. Unfortunately, that is where many would be mistaken. It is a different game when presenting, pitching or simply meeting in person for a coffee and a chat.

## Screen sharing presenting skills

As a provider of[ screen sharing software for inside sales, telesales and customer service teams](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing-for-inside-sales-agents-convert-calls-quicker/), we know a thing or two about the most effective ways to engage prospects on screen sharing calls.

Here are three top tips for a successful screen sharing call:

### #1: Have a call roadmap

Before you start on this journey with a new prospect, have a clear idea what questions you need to ask and what - as a minimum - you need to show them.

On the call, this might change depending on answers to questions they ask, or what they want to know. If they've researched your product/services and company - as many potential buyers do - they might know what they want to ask and find out. If that is the case, make sure to get your qualification questions in, but let them set the pace.

### #2: Listen for audio cues

Unlike in-person presentations and conversations, you aren't going to have those invaluable body language cues. Instead, make sure to ask questions, engage when your project is talking, answer questions, and build up a rapport.

### #3: Never assume

Following on from the above: stop assuming they know what you mean. Unless they helped you write this presentation, your prospect probably doesn’t.

Don't assume for a second that they're looking at what you want them to look at, so either make it clear verbally, point your mouse, or perhaps give your prospect[ a limited amount of remote control](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing-for-inside-sales-agents-convert-calls-quicker/) to engage with with product and get a clearer sense of what you want to show them.

Pay more attention to your audience, not less. In-person makes it harder to miss vital cues. Whereas, behind a screen, they could be bored and disengaged. It could be a way for them to look busy for a while. Unless you pay close attention, you either risk talking too much - and putting your prospect off - or failing to realise that they're not a viable prospect. Either way, pay attention and never assume.

Successful screen sharing calls are a careful balancing act. It isn't as natural as in-person meetings or presentations, nor are they as familiar as sales phone calls. Screen sharing is a modern, remote, blend of the two.

Take time to prepare. Know what you need to ask and where the call needs to go. Have a call roadmap. Make sure to listen to audio cues and never assume.

Always work towards the goal of maximising the engagement potential of a screen sharing call. Get as much information as you need to qualify a prospect and give them as much as you can to get them interested, wanting another call or meeting, or even ready to sign-up. With the right approach and software, screen sharing calls can convert as effectively as in-person meetings.
