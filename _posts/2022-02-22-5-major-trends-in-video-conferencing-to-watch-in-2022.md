## **1. Standardization Of Virtual Meetings {#standardization}**

Virtual meetings used to be occasional at best prior to the pandemic because there was not a major need for them. After the pandemic started, companies needed to use virtual meetings and this helped foster innovation in the industry.

Many companies like RingCentral, Microsoft, Zoom and others had to improve their user experience and ease of use as hundreds of millions of users started to host virtual meetings. You can always start it with the [teaser videos](https://breadnbeyond.com/teaser-videos/) before the meeting has started.

Through virtual meetings, staff could remain in contact with their team regardless of location. With just a link, anyone in the world can start a meeting with their team.

Some of the advantages of using virtual meetings over traditional meetings included:

* Ease of starting and ending meetings
* Affordability: most virtual meeting providers allowed [free meetings](https://crankwheel.com/pricing)
* Less time wasted
* Globalization: teams can now expand their workforce globally through the use of virtual meetings

These advantages listed above were some of the reasons why [video conferencing ](https://www.ringcentral.com/video-conferencing.html)was adopted at unprecedented rates. From small meetings to large-scale events, virtual meetings offered companies a viable alternative to doing everything in-house. With virtual meetings, you can have [webinar presentations](https://chloeteo.com/webinar-presentation-tips), host video conferences and more. This helps companies streamline their remote workforce and improve their productivity.

## **2. Live Video Editing {#editing}**

Live video editing, also called "real-time editing," is the opposite of pre-recorded videos. When a live video is broadcasted, you can display special effects and animations in the video. Live videos are very common during sports broadcasts, where you’ll notice that computer-generated content is displayed on the screen. Due to the popularity of live videos, they’re not restricted to mere sports broadcasts now. Businesses have now started to use live video editing and this is becoming very common during presentations.

With live video editing, you can add edits to the live video when being played. For instance, if you're discussing something about a project or giving a presentation, live video editing can help you generate an immersive, attractive, and appealing output. With the use of live editing, your team can better understand their project's requirements. This is a great step in eliminating the need for previous boring methods like PowerPoint and getting higher grades in annual [employee engagement surveys](https://sparkbay.com/en/culture-blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions-40), for example.

Here are key benefits that favor why live video editing is trending in 2023:

* It helps save time in recording the video and editing it to generate a final result. Instead, with live video editing, the back-end team can directly edit the live video and this saves significant time
* Live video editing is possible remotely.
* Live video editing saves you the time and money it would take to edit a pre-recorded video

## **3. Using Screen Sharing During Video Meetings {#screenshare}**

Screen sharing is a wonderful way to show your teammates what’s occurring on your screen during a presentation. This helps teams collaborate better and avoid wasting time using other bulky tools.

Although screen sharing has been around for years, its adoption skyrocketed during the pandemic. Whether it's a team meeting or sales meeting, screen sharing enables anyone in your business to share their screen and express their ideas within seconds.

Most businesses use Skype or Slack to collaborate with their teams; [screen sharing tools](https://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/) can be easily incorporated into this workflow.

Additionally, the rise of providers like CrankWheel enables businesses to use screen sharing without having to download any software.

Whether you're browsing on desktop or mobile, you can start sharing your screen instantly with CrankWheel.

A few reasons why this trend will continue to rise in 2023 include:

* You can share your screen instantly anywhere in the world
* The screen can be viewed in real-time
* You can share during a regular phone call to any device.
* The viewer doesn't have to install or register for the service
* The viewer can [control the screen remotely](https://crankwheel.com/remote-control/)
* If required, you can define private zones on your screen to blur or hide confidential data.

## **4. Metaverse Meetings {#metaverse}**

The Metaverse has been all the buzz in the business headlines for the past year and companies are starting to capitalize on this new environment by hosting meetings there. The Metaverse is the newest concept involving a 3D virtual world that mimics our world and has many features. The Metaverse is similar to the internet because it's an environment in which people work, play and connect with others.

Since the Metaverse is still in its early stages, there are few real-life applications for businesses. Metaverse meetings are one of the few ways businesses can adopt the Metaverse. With the Metaverse, businesses can host meetings with employees based all over the world in a single virtual room. This allows businesses to have immersive virtual meetings instead of relying on traditional strategies.

As more businesses adopt the Metaverse, videoconferencing will become even more immersive. This will improve the capabilities and bandwidth of virtual meetings and ultimately improve productivity for businesses.

## **5. Zoom’s Dominance In The Videoconference Market {#zoom}**

Another prominent trend in videoconferencing is Zoom's dominance over the market. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Zoom has captured a significant portion of the videoconferencing market. In fact, it's estimated that Zoom has captured over half of the total market in 2023.

There are more than 350 million people who run daily meetings on the platform. In addition, Zoom has witnessed growing active users on the platform. Since the pandemic started, Zoom has continued to experience significant growth in active users month-over-month and year-over-year. As a result, Zoom managed to generate over $2.6 billion in revenue in 2021.

Additionally, Zoom has become standard in the public sector. Schools, governments and nonprofits alike use Zoom to conduct all of their virtual meetings. The vast majority of nonprofit institutions use Zoom for all of their virtual meeting needs. Zoom revealed that over 3.5 trillion minutes of virtual meetings were held on their platform in 2021 in addition to more than 485 million mobile app downloads.

It's clear that Zoom is the industry leader in videoconferencing and this trend will likely continue in 2023 as the company continues to innovate on behalf of customers and further democratizes the use of virtual meetings.
