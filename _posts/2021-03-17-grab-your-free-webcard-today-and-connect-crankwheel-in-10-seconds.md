Whether you are an insurance advisor, a doctor, an accountant, a hairdresser, a real estate agent, an engineer, a marketer, or in any other line of work, we have a hot tip for you. If you do not already have your own personal online presence, your career would greatly benefit from one.

Let’s clarify: We’re not talking about an online presence that’s just for big companies. We’re talking about an online presence for you, yourself, individually, or for your small business. Something you can keep even when you change jobs. Sort of like a profile on LinkedIn, only more flexible and powerful, and it’s branded for you, on your personalized web domain or even a custom domain all of your own. One place to find all the contact details you want to share, link to your company’s site, your social media, and put your personal or small business brand front and centre.

In the past, it has been challenging to carve out a piece of the online frontier, so it’s quite understandable if you don’t already have one.

Let’s find out how a **free** Webcard will let you [build an online presence in minutes](https://crankwheel.web.cards/), and how you can connect it with your CrankWheel account in a couple of easy steps so that your customers can request that you give them a call back and screen share with them.

## Why you might not have an online presence already

It’s possible you thought about building an online presence in the past, but backed out due to some or all of the following worries:

**Technical complexity:** It’s not easy to create a web page, and with every new twist and turn in the technical landscape, it seems to get harder, not easier. Most of us would need to hire a professional web developer to help.

**Up-front costs:** Purchasing a domain name, paying a designer, hiring a web developer, deciding on a platform and procuring a license. All of this can add up to significant costs.

**A stale presence is worse than no presence:** If you go through all of the above to get your presence set up, you might worry that you won’t have the necessary skills to keep your personal online presence up to date. The only thing worse than not having an online presence for yourself, is having one that shows out-of-date information.

**Ongoing costs:** Paying for hosting, renewing your site’s domain name, keeping up with the latest technology changes, and paying professionals to update your site. The costs can easily outweigh the benefits.

**Unreliable help:** Let’s say you jumped through all the hurdles. You found a web developer to implement a website design created by the designer you hired, and you even learned how to use some kludgy system to update your site without needing help. What happens when it breaks down or is infected by a virus, and the web developer you hired years ago has gone on to greener pastures? Do you need to start all over?
