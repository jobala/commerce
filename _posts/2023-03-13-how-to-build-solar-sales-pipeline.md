## How to Build a Pipeline in Solar Sales in 7 Easy Steps {how}

### 1. Identify your target buyers {#ind}

The first step in building a sales pipeline is to identify your ideal customers. In the solar industry, your target buyers can be residential or commercial customers.

Residential customers are typically homeowners who are interested in reducing their energy bills and carbon footprint. Commercial customers can be businesses, schools, and government organizations that want to reduce their energy costs and be more sustainable.

It's essential to create [ideal buyer personas ](https://www.saleshandy.com/blog/ideal-customer-profile/)to understand your target buyers' needs, preferences, and pain points. For example, a buyer persona for a residential customer could be a middle-aged homeowner who is environmentally conscious and has a high energy bill.

Understanding your buyer personas can help you tailor your marketing message and sales pitch to address their specific needs. This step is instrumental in [scaling your solar energy business](https://crankwheel.com/tips-and-tricks-to-scale-your-solar-energy-business/).

By identifying the right target audience, you can significantly reduce your [Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)](https://www.leadsquared.com/learn/sales/cac-customer-acquisition-cost/). This will eventually improve your bottom-line profits.

### 2. Build a list of prospects {#bui}

Once you have identified your target buyers, the next step would be to build a list of prospects. There are several [ways to find prospects](https://crankwheel.com/the-top-15-sales-prospecting-tips/), including online directories, social media, and referrals. You should use different lists for residential consumers and commercial customers.

You can use tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find commercial prospects and their contact information. Create a database of prospects and organize them by location, industry, and size.

It's essential to keep your prospect database up-to-date and track your interactions with them. For example, you can use a [customer relationship management (CRM) tool](https://crankwheel.com/top-10-crm-tools-for-small-and-medium-businesses/) to manage your leads, track your emails, and schedule follow-ups.

### 3. Develop your message {#dev}

Chances are that your competitors are also reaching out to the same buyers as you are. Hence, developing a message that resonates with your target buyers and differentiates your solar company from your competitors can significantly impact your sales.

Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) that highlights your strengths, benefits, and guarantees. Identify your main claims, such as savings, ROI, or environmental impact, and use them consistently across all your marketing channels.

For example, your USP could be "We provide turnkey solar solutions that guarantee 20% savings on your energy bill within the first year."

Your main claims could be savings, environmental impact, and quality of service. Use these claims to create a compelling marketing message and sales pitch that appeals to your target buyers.

### 4. Get found {#get}

The next step is to get your company in the eyes of your target buyers. There are various ways in which you can do this.

#### Website & Blog

[Create a website](https://www.getresponse.com/blog/small-business-website-builders) for your business and **create content** around the solar industry. Use images, videos, and testimonials to showcase your solar projects and customer satisfaction.

#### SEO

#### Chatbots

To get in touch with interested prospects on your website quickly and easily, a WhatsApp chatbot is particularly useful for both residential and commercial customers. You can then [share screen with WhatsApp](https://crankwheel.com/how-to-screen-share-with-whatsapp/) to explain your solar proposition.

### 5. Reach out {#rea}

Outreach is another important step in your solar sales pipeline. The previous step states the different strategies you can implement to get discovered by your prospects. Combining those strategies with outreach can be a great way to boost your solar sales.

You can also use cold emailing or cold calling to introduce your solar solutions to prospects. It is important to research your target companies and buyers to tailor the outreach messages.

For example, you can use case studies, whitepapers, or industry reports to demonstrate your solar expertise and the benefits of your solutions. Make sure to personalize your message and show how your solutions can solve your prospects' specific pain points.

Social selling on LinkedIn can be a great way to reach commercial clients. This involves building relationships with decision-makers and influencers in your target companies. LinkedIn automation tools can help you [automate LinkedIn](https://skylead.io/blog/linkedin-automation-tools/) requests and messages to reach various target customers with personalized messages.

### 6. Capture leads, nurture them & close the deal {#cap}

Once you have reached out to prospects, it's time to capture their information and nurture them through the sales funnel. Use lead magnets like e-books, guides, or calculators to offer value and encourage prospects to provide their contact information.

For example, [Energysage](https://www.energysage.com/solar/calculator/) has developed an energy savings calculator that helps customers determine the energy savings for their home or business based on their energy consumption and other factors. By offering this type of tool, solar providers can generate valuable leads and demonstrate their expertise to potential customers.

Use email marketing to [build an email list](https://moosend.com/blog/how-to-build-an-email-list-from-scratch/), nurture your leads, and provide them with relevant content based on their stage in the sales funnel.

For example, for prospects in the consideration phase, you can provide a worksheet, case studies, product comparisons, or testimonials.

For prospects in the decision-making phase, you can provide consultations or special offers.

Make sure to use the content for every stage of the sales funnel and showcase the benefits and features of your solar solutions. Use visual aids, such as videos or infographics, to explain complex concepts or calculations.

Also, provide social proof, such as customer reviews or industry certifications, to build trust and credibility with your prospects.

Finally, close the deal by providing a clear and compelling offer that addresses your prospects' needs and preferences. Use a consultative approach to address their objections or concerns and provide them with a sense of urgency to act.

### 7. Post-Sale follow-up {#pos}

After closing the deal, it's essential to delight your customers and encourage them to refer you to their network. Use cross-selling and upselling strategies to offer complementary solar solutions or maintenance services.

Use surveys or feedback forms to gather feedback and improve your customer experience. You can use email marketing or SMS to follow up and offer customer support.

Also, use referral programs or testimonials to encourage your satisfied customers to refer you to their friends, family, or colleagues. Building a strong referral network can help you generate more leads and grow your solar business in the long term.
