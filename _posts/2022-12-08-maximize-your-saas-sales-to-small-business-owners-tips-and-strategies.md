## The Difference and Commonalities between B2B Sales and SMB B2B Sales

B2B sales and SMB B2B sales are similar in many ways. In both cases, the salesperson is selling a product or service to another business rather than to an individual consumer. The sales cycle is often longer and more complex, as the decision-making process involves multiple stakeholders and requires a higher level of technical knowledge.

There are some key differences between B2B sales and SMB B2B sales. In B2B sales, the target customer is typically a large enterprise with a significant budget and dedicated resources for purchasing and implementing new solutions. In contrast, SMB B2B sales are focused on smaller businesses with limited budgets and fewer resources.

This means that SMB B2B sales require a more personalized approach and a deep understanding of the specific needs and challenges of small businesses. The salesperson must be able to clearly articulate the value proposition of the product or service and demonstrate how it can help the small business owner improve their operations and grow their business.

## The Difference and Commonalities between B2C Sales and SMB B2B Sales

B2C sales and SMB B2B sales are also similar in many ways. Both involve selling a product or service to an individual consumer, and both require a deep understanding of the target customer’s needs and preferences.

However, there are some key [differences between B2C sales and B2B sales](https://crankwheel.com/b2b-sales-vs.b2c-sales-understanding-the-different-approaches/). In B2C sales, the target customer is typically a single individual who is making a personal purchase. In SMB B2B sales, the target customer is a small business owner who is making a purchase on behalf of their business.

This means that SMB B2B sales require a different approach than B2C sales. The salesperson must be able to clearly articulate the value proposition of the product or service in terms of how it can help the small business owner improve their operations and grow their business.

The salesperson must also be able to address any concerns the small business owner may have about the cost, implementation, and long-term support of the product or service.

## How SMB B2B Sales are Unique

SMB B2B sales are unique in several ways.

First, small business owners are often busy, impatient, and difficult to reach. This means that the salesperson must be able to quickly and effectively engage the small business owner and demonstrate the value of the product or service in a short amount of time.

Second, small business owners are often not always in front of a computer. This means that the salesperson must be able to provide demos and other sales collateral on the go, using mobile devices and other technologies.

Third, small business owners are often not familiar with complex technical concepts and may not have the time or expertise to fully evaluate the product or service. This means that the salesperson must be able to explain the product or service in simple, easy-to-understand terms and provide clear and concise answers to any questions the small business owner may have.

## Types of SMBs

SMBs come in many different shapes and sizes, and each type of small business has its own unique challenges and needs. Some common types of SMBs include tradespeople, bars, restaurants, and barbershops.

**Tradespeople**, such as electricians, plumbers, and carpenters, often work on a freelance or contract basis and may not have a dedicated office or storefront. This makes it difficult for them to access and use traditional SaaS solutions, which require a stable internet connection and a computer.

**Bars, restaurants** and other hospitality businesses have complex and fast-paced operations, and they often need to manage multiple customer relationships and handle large amounts of data. Traditional SaaS solutions may not be able to keep up with their needs, and they may require specialized solutions that can handle their unique requirements.

**Barbershops** and other personal care businesses may have limited budgets and may not be able to afford traditional SaaS solutions. They may require specialized solutions that are affordable and easy to use, and that can help them manage their operations and grow their business.

## The Persona of a Small Business Owner

Small business owners are busy, impatient, and often hard to reach. They are constantly juggling multiple tasks and responsibilities, and they may not have the time or patience to talk to salespeople or evaluate new solutions.

### Here are some common traits of a small business owner:

* **They are always busy**: Small business owners are constantly on the go, and they may not have the time or patience to talk to salespeople or evaluate new solutions.
* **They are impatient**: Small business owners are often in a hurry and may not have the time or patience to listen to long sales pitches or evaluate complex solutions.
* **It’s difficult to get a meeting**: Small business owners are often hard to reach, and they may not be interested in meeting with salespeople or attending sales events.
* **They might not always pick up the phone**: Small business owners may not always answer their phone and they may not respond to voicemails or emails from salespeople.
* **They are not always in front of a computer**: Small business owners may not always be in front of a computer, and they may not have access to a stable internet connection or a computer with the right software and hardware.

Understanding the unique needs and challenges of small business owners is key to selling SaaS products to them. This involves conducting research, asking targeted questions, and listening carefully to their pain points and priorities. By gaining insight into their business operations and goals, you can tailor your sales pitch and product demonstrations to their specific needs.

### 2. Offer personalized solutions and demos that address their specific needs

Offering personalized solutions and demos that address the needs of small business owners is an effective way to sell SaaS products. This involves demonstrating how your SaaS solution can solve their specific challenges and improve their business operations. By showing them how your product works in their specific context, you can convince them of its value and relevance to their business.

### 3. Demonstrate the cost-saving benefits of SaaS solutions

Demonstrating the cost-saving benefits of SaaS solutions is an important selling point for small business owners. Many small businesses operate on tight budgets and are always looking for ways to save money. By highlighting how your SaaS product can reduce costs and increase efficiency, you can convince them to invest in your solution.

### 4. Highlight the scalability and flexibility of SaaS products

Highlighting the scalability and flexibility of SaaS products is another effective selling strategy. Small businesses often experience rapid growth and changes in their operations, and they need solutions that can adapt to their evolving needs. By showing how your SaaS product can scale with their business and accommodate their changing requirements, you can convince them of its value.

### 5. Educate small business owners on the security and reliability of SaaS

Educating small business owners on the security and reliability of SaaS is crucial for building trust and winning their business. Many small business owners are concerned about the safety and integrity of their data and operations, and they need reassurance that your SaaS solution can protect them from threats and disruptions. By providing information on your product's security features and reliability, you can allay their fears and convince them of its value.

### 6. Showcase customer success stories and testimonials

Showcasing customer success stories and testimonials is a powerful way to sell SaaS products to small business owners.

Testimonials from satisfied customers can also provide social proof and build trust, which are essential for winning their business.

### 7. Offer comprehensive support and training resources

Offering comprehensive support and training resources is another important selling point for SaaS products. Small business owners often have limited time and resources, and they need access to support and training to get the most out of your solution. By providing them with a range of resources, including tutorials, webinars, and customer support, you can help them get up and running quickly and maximize their use of your product.

### 8. Position SaaS as a competitive advantage and essential tool for growth

Positioning SaaS as a competitive advantage and essential tool for growth is a compelling selling strategy. Many small business owners are always looking for ways to stay ahead of the competition and grow their business. By showing how your SaaS product can help them gain a competitive edge and accelerate their growth, you can convince them of its value and relevance to their business.

### 9. Create compelling marketing materials and sales presentations

Creating compelling marketing materials and sales presentations is crucial for selling SaaS products to small business owners. This involves developing engaging content and visuals that showcase the benefits and value of your product and presenting them in a clear and compelling way. By creating engaging marketing materials and sales presentations, you can capture the attention of small business owners and convince them of the value of your SaaS solution.

### 10. Stay up-to-date on industry trends and developments in SaaS for small businesses.

Staying up-to-date on industry trends and developments in SaaS for small businesses is important for staying competitive and relevant. This involves staying informed about the latest developments and innovations in the SaaS industry, and adapting your sales strategies and product offerings accordingly. By staying current and responsive to the needs of small business owners, you can maintain your competitive edge and continue to win their business.

## The Strategies you need to become more effective in selling to small business owners

1. **Telesales is easier than door-to-door:** Small business owners are often hard to reach, and they may not be interested in meeting with salespeople or attending sales events. Telesales is often a more effective approach, as it allows the salesperson to quickly and easily engage the small business owner and demonstrate the value of the product or service.
2. **Close in the first call - don’t get another appointment:** Small business owners are often impatient, and they may not have the time or patience to schedule multiple meetings or attend sales events. The salesperson should try to close the sale in the first call, and avoid getting another appointment or scheduling a follow-up meeting.
3. **Qualify the prospect quickly:** Small business owners are often busy, and they may not have the time or patience to talk to salespeople who are not qualified to sell to them. The salesperson should qualify the prospect quickly by asking relevant questions and determining whether the product or service is a good fit for their business.
4. **Demo your product on the call:** Small business owners are often not familiar with complex technical concepts, and they may not have the time or expertise to fully evaluate the product or service. The salesperson should demonstrate the product or service on the call, using screen-sharing software and other tools, to show the small business owner how it works and how it can help them improve their operations and grow their business.
5. **Personalize the demo:** Small business owners are often busy, impatient, and hard to reach, and they may not be interested in generic sales pitches or demos. The salesperson should personalize the demo by showing the small business owner how their use case would appear in the solution, and by highlighting the specific features and benefits that are relevant to their business.
6. **Send a follow-up email with a video:** Make notes of the product features that your prospect was most interested in. Then do a screen recording where you show those features in a quick walkthrough. If you just mentioned a feature that has not been released yet, [record a Figma prototype](https://crankwheel.com/how-to-record-your-figma-prototype-the-easy-way/) and attach it to your email.
7. **After the sale: Onboarding:** After the sale, the salesperson should provide the small business owner with clear and concise instructions on how to implement and use the product or service. This will help the small business owner get started quickly and avoid any problems or delays.
8. **Pitching to small business owners that don’t have time to talk on the phone:** Some small business owners may not have the time or patience to talk on the phone, and they may prefer to communicate via email or other channels. The salesperson should be flexible and adaptable and should be able to provide demos, sales collateral, and other materials via email or other channels to help the small business owner evaluate the product or service.
