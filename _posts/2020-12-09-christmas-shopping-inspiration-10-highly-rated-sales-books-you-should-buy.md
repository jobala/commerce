What a year 2020 has been!

Who could have predicted this?

![](/uploads/2020/12/09/cw_christmas-shopping-inspiration.jpg)

Very few people, and those who did weren't taken seriously at the time. Governments, global bodies, and [banks](https://www.bankopening.co.uk/) weren't ready for Coronavirus (Covid-19). Although there is now a light at the end of the tunnel, we are not back to normal yet.

Despite this, salespeople and sales managers and leaders are already thinking about and planning for 2021.

As part of that, it could help to read some sales books. Pick up some new ideas. Or old ones, that could prove refreshing in these challenging times. Let’s take a look at some of the most highly recommended sales books. Good ideas for Christmas, for those who want to focus on their career more in 2021 and improve their sales skills.

## CrankWheel recommends: Top 10 Sales Books

### #1: [SPIN Selling](https://www.amazon.com/SPIN-Selling-Neil-Rackham/dp/0070511136/)

#### Neil Rackham

_What's it about?_

One of the classics, responsible for a whole new way of selling. It was published in 1988, based on 35,000 sales calls recorded over 12 years. Rackham transformed sales with this book, encouraging salespeople to drop pushy sales techniques and instead build value as a trusted sales advisor.

_Why you need this?_

Although many of Rackham’s methods are a part of modern selling, and you could be putting into practice many of his [closing techniques](https://crankwheel.com/the-top-13-telesales-closing-techniques/) without knowing it, you’d benefit from having the original for reference. Have a look at what he said, and adapt your methods accordingly if there are things you could do instead to improve performance.

### #2: [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/)

#### Dale Carnegie

_What's it about?_

Another classic, probably one of the oldest books on sales that still influences how people sell today. Published in 1936, this “simple country boy” from Missouri pioneered what's known as the self-improvement genre of books. Given that it was published when America, and the rest of the world were struggling to emerge from the worst recession in history, it couldn't have come at a better time, and subsequently sold millions.

Well worth reading, even if you aren't in sales. It combines advice and ideas for how to sell better, alongside words of wisdom that are still useful across a wide range of careers.
