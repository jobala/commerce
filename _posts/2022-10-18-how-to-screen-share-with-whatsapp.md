## How you can share your screen on WhatsApp voice or video calls {#call}

When you are in a call, either voice or video, it's best to use your public link. Simply tell your viewers your public link (meeting.is/yourlink). It's a sequence of numbers by default but you can change it in your dashboard.

As a security measure, you will get alerted once a viewer wants to enter via your public link and you will see a number that the viewer will also see. You can accept or reject new viewers to the session.

## How to share your screen in the Android or iOS app? {#mobile}

If you are in a call or a chat on your mobile phone, it's best to start a screen-sharing session as described above and then either type in (chat) or say out loud (video/voice) your public link.
