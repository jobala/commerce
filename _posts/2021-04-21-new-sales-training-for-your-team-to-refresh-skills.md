With everything everyone has been through, since March 2020, it’s understandable if your sales teams skills aren't as sharp as they once were. Sales training can help refresh skills, while supporting these new ways of working.

Sales training helps teams a number of ways. According to [HubSpot, based on CSO Insights research](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/best-sales-training-programs), highly-rated sales training courses (many of which are being delivered remotely right now), can increase win rates 10%.

Could your sales team benefit from 10% higher win rates?

In a team of 10 where the overall annual target for new business is $1 million, that could equate to an extra $100,000 revenue. If the training costs $10,000, then it’s a worthwhile investment.

When it comes to sales training, there are a lot of options. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry, with some big players and numerous self-employed consultants. Courses and training can cost anything from a few thousand ($2,000+) to a few hundred thousand ($100,000+), depending on the amount of training being delivered, size of your team, and other factors.

Let's look at how sales managers assess the right training for their team, and some of the options.

## How to assess the effectiveness of sales training

* **How is it delivered?** These days, remote is definitely best. If you aren't bringing your team into the office, then gathering in one place for a training session may not be the best idea. Only if a suitable space can be used should in-person be the preference; otherwise, aim for online delivery.
* **How much time will it take?** Training is usually delivered in blocks of time, such as a half-day, full-day, or even over several days. Some training is delivered in a hybrid format, between sessions that last a day, alongside online and module-based training.
* **Is it suitable for my team?** You need to ensure it’s suitable for the intended audience. Ensure at minimum the training is designed for the type of team you manage (e.g. outbound, inbound, field - even if they're not “in the field” at the moment, SDRs, etc.)
* **Does it address current challenges?** Whatever your top three, or even top priority challenge is, ensure the training does aim to tackle the problem.

**How much does it cost?** Budget is an important factor of course, as is the intended ROI. Make sure it looks like you should get value for money.

Now let’s take a look at some of the options. Of course there are numerous, hundreds of others around, but these are some that have either caught our attention or are well-known for achieving positive results for sales teams.

## 5 Sales Training Options

### #1: Sandler Selling System, [Sandler](https://www.sandler.com/)

**How it’s delivered:** Sander training is usually delivered for clients in one of their [250 worldwide training centers](https://www.sandler.com/training-centers/) (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Australia). Although most training should be getting delivered remotely at present.

**Timescale:** It can be ongoing, which means it will start with an initial training session, and then be delivered according to the service package agreed.

**Focus:** Improving the sales process.

**Audience:** B2B sales teams, which means outbound, inbound, and account managers.

**Cost:** Depends on the client, number of salespeople and service package agreed. Due to the method-based approach, and expectations placed around the Sandler approach, expect to invest a decent amount if you are getting a year-round training package.

Sales training from Sandler is a long-term investment, and re-enforces itself, so that teams feel continual benefit. It can cover everything from building rapport to setting expectations with new clients. Too much sales training, when it’s one-off is forgotten after 90 days, which is why this approach is valued, although with the required investment to match.

### #2: [Inbound Sales, HubSpot Academy](https://certification.hubspot.com/inbound-sales-certification?_ga=2.235103617.1605459680.1617876140-231956365.1557404656)
