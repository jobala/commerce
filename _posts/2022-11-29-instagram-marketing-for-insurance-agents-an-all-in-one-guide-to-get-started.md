Now you are acquainted with the meaning and importance of Instagram marketing for insurance agents, how do you get started?

### Set Up an Instagram Business Account {#set}

The first step to start your Instagram marketing journey is to create an [Instagram Business Account](https://business.instagram.com/getting-started).

While managing a social media account might be stressful and difficult if you are running a small insurance firm, it helps to hire a social media manager or partner with an influencer to handle the setup and the running of the business account for you.

We understand there are other aspects of your insurance firm that also demand attention. And you might not have the budget to take on a social media manager.

That’s why we’ve come up with these helpful DIY tips to make the process of setting up an Instagram Business Account hassle-free:

* Once you’ve set up an Instagram account, you need to convert it into a business account to enable the features that will help transform your business.
* Go to your profile and click on the menu icon in the top right-hand corner.
* Click on **“Settings.”**
* Then click on **“Switch to Professional Account”**
* Click on “**Continue**”
* Tap on **“OK”** to confirm
* Click on **“Business”** and **“Next”**
* Now you will be asked to add contact details to proceed. But you can skip this step if you are not ready.

The Instagram Business Account comes with special features like data analytics, feature posts, and ad opportunities to promote your brand. Personal Instagram accounts do have these features.

### Define Your Targeted Audience {#def}

Identifying your audience makes it easy to channel all marketing efforts and resources into the group of people that are likely to buy from you.

To get started, come up with a buyer’s persona which gives you a clear picture of your potential audience. It can be likened to an avatar of the common features your targeted audience poses.

The more detailed your buyer’s persona, the better. Age, gender, education level, status, income level, and location are some demographic traits that should be in your buyer’s persona.

However, if your insurance services serve all gender with different age groups, then you need to create multiple personas.

Creating a frictional buyer persona will not be effective and hurt your business. Instead of guess working, use data to gather information about your prospects.

You can gather information about your potential audience with two approaches:

* **Hashtags:** You can use Instagram hashtags to identify your prospects. Search for hashtags relevant to insurance. Then look closely at the profiles using these hashtags. Pay attention to common traits of these profiles - it could be the content they engage in or what they post. It’s tasking but rewarding when you do it right.

* **Pay attention to your competitors:** At the beginning of this guide, we said taking a close look at your competitors gives you insight into how to formulate a better marketing strategy that works. Similarly, you can learn a lot about your targeted audience from others in your industry.

Take note of the kind of followers they have and the content they publish. That can also give you a clear picture of your audience.

Additionally, the Phalanx Influencer Auditor gives you access to valuable analytics like brand mention, location, and other demographics.

Furthermore, make sure your goals and objectives are [SMART](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/smart-goal/) (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely). Here are some examples of how to map out your goals and objectives for Instagram marketing:

With that said, posting content frequently can be tricky. You are prone to typos, tone problems, burnout, and other challenges. But an editorial calendar can help streamline the way you post content on your Instagram Business Account.

An editorial calendar sums up your upcoming Instagram posts. It is usually organized by date and you need it for your social media campaigns, content planning, and reviewing ongoing marketing strategies.

So, what makes a good Instagram caption?

It’s compelling and creates engagement - which is essential for the Instagram algorithm. A thoughtful caption mirrors your brand story, voice, and personality.

* Make the first few sentences count. An average user strolling through their Insta feeds will only see the first sentence of your caption. Therefore, ensure that the first sentence conveys the right message to your audience.
* Add a call to action. Do you want the followers to visit your website, register for a [webinar you’re hosting](https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-webinar-software-platforms/), or click on the link in your bio? Include it in the CTA. The times when you ask questions, encourage them to leave a comment.
* Make sure your captions are valuable to your followers. Ask yourself “what do they stand to gain?” Once you have the answer, it’s easy to move forward from here.
* Add layers of emotions in your captions. You write for humans, not robots.
* Use relevant emojis to evoke emotions.

### Make It Less About You and Your Brand {#mak}

When you only focus on salesy content, it gives your followers the perception that you only care about yourself and your brand.

American author, [Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie), in his book ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People said:

_“I know you know people who are blundering through life trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested in them. Of course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are always interested in themselves — morning, noon, and after dinner”._

Your Instagram followers are not any different. They only care about services, products, and people that improve their lives and businesses.

So, limit the rate at which you post content that directly sells your brand and insurance policies. Instead, prioritize valuable content that provides actionable tips on ways to make their lives better.

Here is a perfect example of how you can make it less about your brand and more about your audience.

[While Liberty Mutual](https://www.instagram.com/libertymutual/) covers auto & vehicle insurance needs, in this post, they didn’t pitch their policies. What they did is offer safety auto tips for your followers in the spring.
