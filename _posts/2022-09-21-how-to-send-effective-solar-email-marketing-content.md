[Email marketing](https://crankwheel.com/5-ways-to-build-brand-identity-and-values-using-email-marketing/) has always been a great way to stay in touch with your audience and keep them up-to-date on your latest solar news and projects. But if you're not sending effective email content, you're doing more harm than good.

When most people think of [solar energy](https://crankwheel.com/how-to-sell-solar-panels-from-home/), they think of large-scale projects that generate power for an entire community or city. But solar energy doesn't have to be limited to those big installations – you can also use solar power for more personal, smaller-scale needs.

## A solid introductory email {#solid}

If you're capturing new subscribers via signup forms, a good first email should include a few elements so they know what they can expect from being on your email list.

1. **Introduce Yourself:** The first step is to introduce yourself and your company. Include a brief overview of your services and how you can benefit the reader.

## How to make sales within your solar email campaigns {#howto}

Sales are the lifeblood of any business, and solar companies are no different. Email campaigns can be an effective way to reach potential customers and [generate sales](https://crankwheel.com/increase-conversion-rates-with-an-effective-b2b-sales-funnel-strategy/).

However, simply sending out a few emails is not enough - you need to take a strategic approach to maximize results. Here are some tips for making sales within your solar email campaigns:

1. **Research your audience:** Who are you trying to reach with your email campaign? What are their needs and desires? Take the time to understand your target market before crafting your message.
2. **Personalize your message:** Generic emails are quickly deleted or ignored. Instead, personalize your message for each recipient. Use the recipient's name, mention common interests, or tailor the content to their specific situation.
3. **Keep it short and sweet**: No one wants to read a long, rambling email. Get to the point quickly and be concise in your writing.
4. **Include a call to action**: What do you want the recipient to do after reading your email? Make it easy for them by including a clear call to action, such as clicking on a link or calling a phone number.

### What is PAS and why does it work? {#whatis}

PAS (Pain, Agitate, Solution) is a three-step approach to [persuasion](https://crankwheel.com/emotional-selling-101-how-to-persuade-customers-to-buy-through-feelings/) that was first proposed by Robert Cialdini in his 1984 book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. Cialdini argued that PAS is an effective way to persuade someone to take a desired course of action.

The three steps are: pain, agitate, and solution.

**Pain:** First identify the individual/audience pain points or the areas in which they are unhappy with their current situation. In the case of your solar audience, this may be the negative effects of electricity, fees, or negative effects on the environment that they feel strongly about.

The initial pain sentence is most effective when it includes some level of shock value or contrarian viewpoint that calls for attention.

**Agitate:** Secondly, agitate these pain points by amplifying them and highlighting the negative consequences of not taking action.

**Solution**: Finally, offer a solution that will address the individual's pain points and help them achieve their desired outcome.

**When used effectively, PAS can be a powerful tool for persuasion.**

**An example of PAS**

Below is an example of using PAS in the context of an email marketing campaign going out to a solar audience.

**Problem:** You're about to become broke because of the power you use

**Agitate:** There's nothing worse than getting an over-the-top power bill in winter, which means you have to put all the fun in your life on hold. Why do you work so hard when all your money goes on bills, resulting in you not being able to do the things you want to do?

**Solution:** There's a way to stop all this now. And the reason most people haven't stopped living like this is they don't know enough about solar energy or how to go about using it.

It's no secret that solar energy is the future of energy. Not only is it a renewable resource, but it also doesn't produce any harmful emissions like fossil fuels. So why don't most people know anything about it and continue to spend way too much on monthly bills?

That's where we come in!

We provide easy-to-follow guides on how to set up a solar system and make the switch to solar power with affordable financing options so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of solar energy freeing easing the strain on your monthly bills, so you can get back to doing what you love.

## How often should you be sending emails? {#how}

How often you should be sending solar email content to your subscribers depends on a few factors. First, consider the frequency with which you release new content. If you're constantly producing new and relevant solar content, then you'll want to send more frequent emails to keep your subscribers up-to-date.

On the other hand, if you're only releasing new content sporadically, then you can afford to send emails less often. Second, take into account the preferences of your subscribers. Some people may want to receive daily email updates, while others may prefer weekly or monthly summaries.

Asking your subscribers how often they want to receive email updates is a good way to gauge their preferences.

Finally, consider your own resources and capacity. Sending frequent email updates requires more time and effort than sending infrequent updates, so make sure you have the bandwidth to commit to a more regular schedule.

Ultimately, there's no hard and fast rule for how often you should be sending solar email content to your subscribers; it all depends on your specific situation and audience.

## Additional tips for creating successful solar email marketing campaigns {#add}

To create a successful solar email marketing campaign, there are a few additional tips to keep in mind.

1. Make sure that the email list being used **is up-to-date and accurate**. There is nothing worse than sending emails to people who are no longer interested in your products or services.
2. **Emails should be personalized and relevant** to the recipient. Include the recipient's name in the subject line and body of the email, and make sure the content is relevant to their interests.
3. Have a **strong subject line** that will grab attention and entice recipients to open the email. (Remember PAS)
4. **Include a call to action**. Tell recipients what you want them to do after reading your email, such as visiting your website or scheduling a consultation.
5. **Track results** and analyze data to continually optimize campaigns and ensure they are as effective as possible.
6. **Maintain consistent brand identity** throughout the campaign. By following these tips, you can ensure that your solar email marketing campaign is successful.
7. Have a strong online presence. There are two reasons for investing in [digital marketing for solar](https://crankwheel.com/10-proven-digital-marketing-strategies-for-solar-sales-agents/). For one, it creates credibility - when people have seen your email, they might have a look around the Internet and visit your homepage. And most people won't take immediate action on your emails. If you target your audience from different angles, they are more likely to come to you when they are ready to buy solar.
