## The basics before you make a cold call

First, before you start your cold call, make sure you are prepared. This means having a solid pitch ready, knowing your target market inside and out, and researching the company you are calling.

When making a cold call, put yourself in the customer's shoes. What are they likely to be interested in? What are their needs and wants? Tailor your opening lines to match what you know about the customer.

Not everyone is comfortable making cold calls. If you're feeling nervous, take a deep breath and remember that a prospective customer is just a person, just like you. They may be busy, but they'll appreciate your effort if you can provide them with value.

Remember, your prospect might also be apprehensive about the call, so try to put them at ease. Be friendly and upbeat, and let your prospect know that you're excited to help them with whatever they need.

One of the best ways to start a cold call is by mentioning a referral. A referral is a trusted source who can vouch for you and your product or service. This shows the customer that you are credible and worth listening to.

Here's an example of using this opening line: "Hi, Ms. Smith. I'm Mark from ABC Company. I was referred to you by Mr. James, who said you might be interested in our new product."

When you mention a referral, it shows that you have done your homework and that you're not just cold calling at random. It also helps build trust with the customer and helps build a connection with the person you're speaking to.

#### 2. Open by asking if the prospect is busy {#busy}

Another way to start a cold call is by asking the prospect if they are busy. Professionals are usually busy, so this can be a great way to see if the person is available to speak.

Here's an example of using this opening line: "Hi, Ms. Smith. I hope you're having a great day. I'm Mark from ABC Company. I'm calling to see if you're available to chat for a few minutes."

This line shows that you are considerate and don't want to waste the prospect's time. It also helps to build rapport and make the customer feel important.

## Cold calling opening lines to avoid {#avoid}

Now that you know some of the best cold call opening lines let's take a look at some of the ones to avoid.

Here are five cold calling opening lines to avoid:

#### 1. Open by asking for a meeting

This is one of the most common cold call opening lines, and it often fails. Prospects usually don't want to meet with someone they don't know, so it's best to avoid this line. It will make the prospect feel like you're pushy and that you don't respect their time.

#### 2. Open by asking for their business

Prospects usually don't want to give their business away to someone they don't know, so it's best to avoid this line.

#### 3. Open with a long-winded sales pitch

Prospects usually don't want to listen to a lengthy sales pitch, so it's best to avoid this line.

#### 4. Opening with an apology

Don't start your call by apologizing for calling. This will make the prospect feel like you're not confident and makes them less likely to want to do business with you.

#### 5. Open by talking only about yourself

This is another standard cold call opening line that often fails. Prospects usually don't want to listen to someone talk only about themselves, so it's best to avoid this line. It will make the prospect feel like you're self-centered and that they're not important. Please focus on the prospect and their needs, not on yourself.

## Cold calling best practices {#practices}

There are a few cold-calling best practices that you should follow. These include:

 1. **Do your research:** Find out as much as you can about the prospect before calling them. This will help you personalize your pitch and make it more relevant to them.
 2. **Make sure you have a clear goal for the call:** What do you want to achieve from this call? Whether it is to make a sale, get a meeting, or establish contact, make sure you have a clear goal in mind.
 3. **Be prepared for objections and have a response ready:** Objections are a natural part of the sales process. Be prepared for them and have a response ready to overcome them. This will show that you're knowledgeable about the product and ready to address any concerns the prospect may have.
 4. **Prepare, but be flexible:** The best way to prepare for a cold call is by having a script or outline of what you want to say. However, be prepared to deviate from it if the prospect wants to talk about something else. This will show that you're flexible and willing to engage in a conversation with the prospect.
 5. **Be confident:** This is the most important thing. You need to be confident in what you're saying and how you're saying it. If you sound unsure of yourself, your pitch will reflect it, and the prospect will be less likely to do business with you.
 6. **Be friendly and personable:** The best way to close a cold call is by being friendly and personable. Your prospective customer is more likely to be receptive to your pitch if they like you. After the call, thank the prospect for their time and let them know that you'll follow up with them. This will leave a positive impression and make them more likely to do business with you.
 7. **Make a list of questions to ask the prospect:** This will help you gather information about the prospect and their business. It will also help you qualify them and determine if they're a good fit for your product or service.
 8. **Be prepared to answer any questions the prospect might have:** Be prepared to answer any questions the prospect might have about your product or service. This will help you build trust and establish a connection with them.
 9. **Use a call script:** A call script is a great way to ensure that you cover all the crucial points during a cold call. A script will also help you stay focused and avoid rambling on.
10. **Stay upbeat:** The best way to stay optimistic during a cold call is by having a positive attitude. If you're not feeling confident, your pitch will reflect it, and the prospect will be less likely to do business with you.
11. **Practice, practice, practice:** The more comfortable you are with your pitch, the better it will sound. If you have a video call, make sure you practice in front of the camera to look and sound confident.
12. **Be persistent:** Don't give up if the prospect doesn't want to do business with you. Keep trying, and don't take no for an answer. Sometimes it takes some more effort to close the deal. However, be careful not to come across as pushy or aggressive.
13. **Follow up with the prospect:** After the call, follow up with the prospect, thank them for their time, and let them know that you'll be in touch. Sending a crisp video message will add a personal touch and keep you top of mind. There are several [free video editing software](https://invideo.io/blog/best-free-video-editing-softwares/) that you can use to create a follow-up video.
