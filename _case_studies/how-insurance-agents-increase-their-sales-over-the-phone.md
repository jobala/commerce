    CrankWheel is used by insurance agents across the US to help customers find the best insurance for their needs. By screen sharing, agents can reach interested leads wherever they are and no matter what they are doing.

    It does not matter if prospects are sitting in front of their computers at home, or are out for a walk, insurance agents can cast their screens to any device that has an Internet connection.

    CrankWheel enables agents to be compliant without meeting people face to face. Which means that they can reach prospects across the country.

    **CrankWheel increases the chance that you’re getting a sale by at least 60%**

    CrankWheel allows me to separate myself from any other broker or agent that might be trying to contact the client just due to how transparent I am. I have all my agents using CrankWheel as well. If you are in sales in any industry, you should be able to use CrankWheel very easily. It’s the most cost-effective screen sharing platform that’s on the market for sure.

  content: "CrankWheel helps agents to establish trust and transparency early on in
    the call. After they have qualified the lead, they start the screen sharing session
    by showing the license they have issued in the state the prospect is living in.
    \n\nThe agent can pause the screen sharing at any time. Many agents pause the
    session while they are asking prospects background questions that they fill out
    into forms to build the quotes. They can then pull up quotes and compare available
    options.\n\nBy running the calculations and sharing the results of available options
    on-screen, agents are able to show that they are not biased toward one particular
    insurance company."

    **Using CrankWheel is crucial in my job. If we don’t, it’s not in compliance - I’m licensed in 32 different states and I can’t do face-to-face meetings.**

    It’s not rocket science. Without face-to-face in the insurance world, you have to do a screen share. When I have qualified the leads, I shoot them a message with the link and they connect instantly. I can then show them that I’m licensed in their state and then we can go over their options.

  title: Prospects see the agent's screen in seconds without a download
  content: It’s easy for agents to get prospects connected. For the prospect to enter
    the screen sharing session, the agent can send a link to the meeting with a text
    message, email or simply ask the prospect to type in the easy public link that
    is unique to the agent. The prospect enters the meeting in seconds since there
    is no need to download anything and viewers don’t share their webcams.

    **It’s just a very easy platform for screen sharing with customers. It’s inexpensive and simple to use**

    With CrankWheel, I can show my clients brochures, the coverage and the application. I can bring them into all of it on the phone call. If they are no longer paying attention, I can see it and redirect their attention back to the call.

    Agents get a live preview window of what the prospect is viewing. The preview window shows the agent how the viewer is interacting with the presentation such as where their mouse cursor is moving, which area of the presentation mobile users are zooming in on, and they get alerted instantly if the viewer disconnects or has switched over to another tab or another app. Agents can also see if the viewer’s device has not caught up with the presentation due to a bad Internet connection. So there is no risk of running ahead with the presentation for the agent.

    When the session ends, the browser tab the prospect was viewing the session in, automatically redirects to a landing page the agent can set. Most agents use this post-session redirect feature to send prospects to their Google Review page or to a page that helps prospects to refer friends to the agent.
