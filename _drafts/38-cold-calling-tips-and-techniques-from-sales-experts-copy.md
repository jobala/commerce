Cold calling is probably the hardest part of sales. Obviously not because of all the travel, but it’s psychologically demanding, especially for beginners but veteran salespeople still have the shivers when starting their cold calling routine.

Let’s face it, you are up against the odds. You will have a list of people in front of you that might not even qualify for the product or services you are selling. You might call them at a bad time. Most people will say no to you before you even start your pitch.

It’s completely normal to feel daunted by the task of cold calling. But there is no need to make it stop you from becoming a successful cold caller.

You will have to prepare as much as you can and be ready to face the unknown prospects. And be prepared to improvise when the call goes off-script.

In order to help you to come prepared for success in cold calling, we reached out to 30 sales experts for advice on their top tips and techniques for cold calling.

## Scientific fact: The number one success factor in cold calling {#science}

There have been numerous studies done about cold calling. Only a handful of them look at which personality traits contribute the most to success in cold calling. And there is one dominating factor that can make or break a salesperson:

* **Optimism**: Optimistic salespeople outsell by 20-40% and pessimistic salespeople are more likely to give up on the job and quit within the year ([P Schuman, 1999](http://www.dyane.net/linked/9.2.%20%20Applying%20learned%20optimism%20to%20increase%20sales%20productivity.pdf))

If you are an optimistic person, you already have an advantage. But if you are pessimistic, don’t let your pessimistic nature make you quit the job yet! The good news is that you can train your brain towards more optimism.

According to Schuman, pessimism is mostly an error in logic and irrational beliefs. It is basically how you decide to view and interpret things. If you are able to identify those irrational reactions and react to them, you can start viewing the world in a positive way.

## How to motivate yourself and get over the fear of Cold Calling {#fearofcoldcalling}

The best cure for the fear of cold calling is to start cold calling. Get on a run and it becomes easier. But it’s easier said than done to begin. Even veteran salespeople start procrastinating instead of picking up the phone. The hardest part of sales is talking to cold leads.

The good thing here is that this is an irrational fear, most likely a lizard-brain reaction to modern-day life. This means that all you have to do is to remember that this is irrational.

So keep this in mind:

* **It’s a natural feeling. Stay optimistic**
* **This is not the end of the world**
* **Set up a pre-calling routine to boost your spirits**
* **Set a daily target for the number of calls**

When you are getting started, you will have to accept that you are going to hear the word no a lot.

Change your perspective and look at the positives:

* It’s an opportunity to learn. The more rejections you get, you will be able to test and fine-tune your pitch to perfection
* Being rejected doesn’t feel good but you will have to remember that it’s a numbers game. The more rejections you get, you are getting closer to closing the sale.

The more rejections you get, the more you will be able to reflect back on your strategy and ask yourself **these questions to refine your cold calling technique**:

* **Is the price right?**
* **Is the product positioned correctly?**
* **Are you calling at the right time of day?**
* **Is my list any good?**
* **Are people more likely to respond to emotional selling points rather than practical ones?**
* **Should my emphasis be on benefits or features?**

A sales script is a good way to cover all the points that your pitch should include. But don’t rely too much on the script and don’t treat it as scripture. Some people can read a script and sound natural but it can often sound too rehearsed and unnatural.

It’s a good idea to use a script when you are starting out with a new product or are new at the job. When you think you know the script by heart, a good idea is to write down bullet points of things that you want to make sure to cover. It is especially good to have those reminders on longer sales calls.

Using a script can also help you fine-tune your pitch. Have it printed out and mark things that are important and strike out those that aren’t. Make notes and add them to the script and print out a fresh, improved copy.

### Scripts help bring clarity to your thoughts

## Your communication style during a cold call {#communication}

It doesn’t matter if you use a script or not, you will have to decide on how you deliver your pitch and how you carry on the conversation. Be mindful of the tone of voice you are going to use and how you want to keep the flow of the conversation going. Avoid awkward silences by being prepared for them.

Think of yourself as a brand. For the first seconds, before you can engage with prospects in a screen sharing session, your voice and how you deliver your pitch are the only things prospects can use to determine whether they should hang up or stay on the line.

## Practice your cold calling {#practice}

## Research will do wonders for your cold calls {#research}

An important thing to remember, especially for higher ticket items, is that you are trying to establish a relationship with the prospect. Let them know that you have put the effort and work into knowing their pain and why the product or service you are selling is the right thing for them.

By doing the groundwork, you can show that you are an expert in the problems your prospect needs to solve. This establishes trust, not only for you but also for the product or solution you are providing.

Try to find out everything there is to know about the company, its industry and the person you should be talking to. Once you have identified the right person to talk to, either a gatekeeper or a decision-maker, do some research on that person as well. You might have something in common that would help you break the ice.

## Why you should conduct research on prospects before a cold call {#whyresearch}

Research should be part of your prospecting process. First off, you should start with a wide scope and then narrow it down. The research helps you narrow down companies or people that would be suitable for your product.

### Research respects your prospect’s time

### Keep up with the latest trends.

"Monitor changing trends, new regulations, and other changes in your prospect's sector to have a better understanding of it. This information may then be used to tie your service or product to a need that your prospect has due to company developments." **-** **Jeff Mains**

### Don’t dial random numbers

"Cold calling necessitates the application of hard facts. To adequately express your sales message, you must understand the prospect on the phone.

Expect to have no luck contacting random numbers and speaking with whoever answers the phone. Cold calling should be undertaken with prudence. What qualifies the person on the other end of the line as a target customer? " **-** **Andrew Dale**

### Research helps create a tailor-made pitch

"Make a list of potential targets. Before you start making calls, make a list of potential targets - this could be a list of businesses in your area or a list of people who you think may be interested in your product or service.

Do your research. Once you have a list of potential targets, do your research to tailor your sales pitch to their needs." **-** **Randy VanderVaate**

### Know your customer

"Before making a call, it is important to gather all the relevant information about the likings and dislikings, tastes and preferences, their location, gender, age, etc., of your target audience.

It will help you get an idea of the questions that you will receive from the other end. In addition, the spontaneous response to their questions will increase your confidence, and you will be better able to pitch your deliverables." - **Rahul Vij**

## How do you research prospects before cold calling? {#howtoresearch}

Further research helps you narrow down individual characteristics. Don’t have the criteria too industry-specific. Make note of facts that might come in handy later on.

Did the person live in the area you grew up in? Did your uncle work for the same company?

Understanding the business side shows that your product can be trusted. Relating on a personal level with the prospect creates a relationship that opens the door for your product or service.

Online, you can find member directories for trade associations, comments from people with a problem that you can solve and you can see the latest news on a company’s website. LinkedIn is the best source for the latest news on companies you are targeting as well as seeing career milestones of your individual prospects.

### Use LinkedIn

"Picking up the phone and dialing aimlessly without proper research, can lead you nowhere. You should research the prospect client thoroughly and make sure if their business operates in a similar niche.

Ideally, you should go over the client’s website and LinkedIn profile, allowing you to get to know them a little better. This would allow you to get to know the clients on an interpersonal level, which would allow for a natural conversation during the cold call." **- Scott Keever**

### Never do blind cold calling

"You HAVE to know who you're pursuing. And, with the resources at your disposal today, there is no reason to go into a cold call blind.

LinkedIn simplifies this process. When our sales team makes a prospecting call, they need to know how many sales representatives the prospecting organization has. LinkedIn provides a plethora of data, including growth rates, employee counts, and sales rep counts." **- Tim Davidson**

## How you can warm up leads with Social Media {#socialmedia}

Social media platforms give salespeople endless opportunities to qualify leads and connect with prospects before calling them. Interaction on social media platforms is a great way to warm up leads.

You don’t have to interact with them directly but if your name and your expertise will pop up on their feeds, they are more likely to recognize you when you make the first cold call. Even if they reject your pitch, they will get a constant reminder of you and will be contacting you when the moment comes.

## The basics you should keep in mind before cold calling {#basics}

Before you start cold calling, there are some tips that you should keep in mind. They might not necessarily be relevant or applicable in your case. But keep them in mind and see how you could adapt them to fit into your cold calling strategy.

### Make use of a local phone number

"Consider utilizing a local number when contacting people on your list if you operate as an independent contractor or a sales call center. Using a local phone number increases the chances of someone picking up your call.

When prospects encounter an unknown number with a long-distance area code, they often dismiss it as spam and do not respond." **- Jeff Mains**

### Set a goal

"My most important piece of advice is to set a goal. prior to calling the number. You should begin with a specific goal in mind that you want to achieve at the end of the call.

While closing a transaction is the ultimate goal, the initial goal should be to get your prospects to consent to a meeting. It can occur at any time, depending on the circumstances.

Some people will agree to a meeting right away, while others will need to be persuaded. You can better organize your time and resources if you have a well-defined aim." **- Taylor Murchison**

## How you should start a cold call {#startcoldcall}

It’s hard to decide what is the most important part of cold calling. You should put the most effort into the opening of the call.

Consider it to be the headline of your pitch. For every dollar you spend on your pitch, 80 cents should be on the opening. As with headlines, the opening helps the prospect decide if the that follows is worth the time.

### Be proficient

"I would recommend you to begin by stating the reason for your call. By beginning your call with a brief explanation of why you're calling, you can raise your success rate by 2.1X. Humans require justifications, even if they are not particularly compelling" **-** **Tim Davidson**

### Never start with “Hi, I'm XYZ from ABC”

"This is an instant giveaway that this is a sales call.

Instead, start with a question to evoke a response. For example: “Hello. May I speak with ABC?”

After which you can always start with their problem first to get them interested and offer the solution right at the end.

The worst mistake most people make is starting with the solution, that's a giveaway that you're hard selling something." **- Danny Marshall**

## Active listening: The art of talking less and achieving so much more {#activelistening}

People love talking about themselves. When you are making a cold call, ask questions and then listen. Don’t interrupt, let them do most of the talking. But be careful of zoning out, you will have to be an active listener.

Be genuinely interested in the person you are talking to and prod them with further questions. If further questions arise, don’t interrupt them, write the questions down and ask them later. People usually say what you want to know without a direct question.

### Practice curiosity and keep an open mind.

"Thinking in boxes and categories is a human trait. Judging a person based on their social status, career position or looks is something our mind often does on autopilot because it suggests security.

Try to avoid thinking in boxes and stay curious throughout the conversation.

Ask questions and let the other person lead. The best salesmen or women listen more than they talk. Show your potential customer that you are really interested in them by asking honest questions.

The main goal of your first call with someone shouldn’t be to make them buy your product, but to gather as much information as you can about them." **- Rayk Hahne**

## How to end a cold call? {#endcall}

As we have covered, preparation is just as important as your conversation style during a cold call. When you are finishing up a successful or semi-successful call, you have to keep in mind that you have formed a relationship with the person on the other line. There are some ways to [build trust after a cold call](https://crankwheel.com/four-ways-to-quickly-build-trust-after-a-cold-call/).

You might have been able to [close the sale in the first call](https://crankwheel.com/four-ways-instant-screen-sharing-helps-sales/) but it's also likely that you might need a follow-up call. It seems like a no-brainer but many salespeople forget to make the follow-up or check in with the customer after the first call.
