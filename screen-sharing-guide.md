## Prepare {#prepare}

The key to implementing new technology in your sales processes is preparation.

CrankWheel is easy to use and most of your team will use the new piece of technology within minutes, except for those few who always need more training.

You might have to adapt the processes and let them test drive a few presentations with screen sharing to make sure that everything will run smoothly on real calls.

### Adapt your process to screen sharing {#adapt-your-process}

With screen sharing, you are giving your salesforce a new tool. You are not replacing what you already have.

You can look at screen-sharing sessions as a bridge between phone calls and in-person meetings.

If your team is mostly trained for inside sales you will have to adapt your sales process to the possibility of adding visual elements to the calls.

If your team is trained for in-person meetings, either at your premises or in field sales, the process is not a big leap but the approach needs a little tinkering.

### Train your staff {#train-your-staff}

When you have figured out how you will adapt screen sharing to the process, you will need to train your staff.

CrankWheel is easy to set up and simple to command but it’s a good idea to run through different scenarios that your team might go through.

The customer needs to know that the screen share is just a click away and they don’t have to install anything or share their camera.

## Getting buy-in {#getting-buy-in}

To get the most out of the benefits of screen sharing, you will need to get the most of your team on board. You need to address their inner salesman by showing them data and results.

### Screen sharing sessions as a Key Performance Indicator {#screen-sharing-sessions}

To get the whole team behind using CrankWheel, most of our customers have included CrankWheel sessions and usage as part of their Key Performance Indicators.

There are two reasons behind it. For one, they know that screen-sharing sessions shorten the sales cycle and increase closing rates. Second, by adding usage to the KPI’s, they encourage usage since it reinforces the notion that screen sharing creates results.

### Track and report results {#track-and-report}

Any team leaders in sales know that collecting data on what delivers results is important. We are always trying to improve and data shows us what works and what doesn’t.

The results shouldn’t be a private matter for managers. If you show the team what works, you encourage best sales practices. Teaching old, successful sales dogs to sit with new technology can be hard but they are driven by results.

By showing the success of those who adapt early to screen sharing versus those who don’t, you offer further encouragement. But remember; some dogs don’t need a thousand words to paint a picture - screen sharing is for the rest of us.

## Setup for success {#setup}

Every CrankWheel user is unique and different in terms of what they consider the best setup for their computers and how they present. But there are few things that the most successful have in common.

### Two Monitor setup {#two-monitor}

Although some just need a laptop, the way to have your team ready for complimenting sales calls with screen-sharing is the two monitor setup, one to present and one for processing.

The rule is to have one desktop clean for presenting and the other one with documents and applications ready. The processing desktop can be used to make notes.

This setup ensures that the customer only sees what they are supposed to see, there is no accidental sharing of information of other customers and they won’t see a desktop full of shortcuts and saved documents.

The processing desktop should be set as primary to make sure that those annoying notifications don’t pop up on the screen share.

### The right presentation process {#the-right-presentation}

Determine in what order you want the materials to be presented. Find out how you can most successfully build up the value you are providing and then attach a price to the value.

Remember that your team should be prepared to play it by hand - there might be steps in the process that some customers are not interested in and others that they are more interested in.

Your team needs to know the process so they can jump back and forth between relevant material.

### Have relevant presentations and online resources ready {#relevant-presentations}

Before the screen sharing begins, the presenter should have all the material ready. It can be just a simple presentation on a pdf but it can be multiple slideshows, calculations and websites. (Here’s a handy trick to have all online material ready in just one click).

### Re-engage {#re-engage}

In an in-person engagement, veteran salespeople can easily spot when people are zoning out or losing interest. This can be tricky during sales calls when you don’t meet eye to eye with the customer.

In CrankWheel, you can use the preview window to monitor where your customers’ attention is and if they are engaging in the presentation. You can see if they are not viewing the presentation or if their pointer has become idle.

Be prepared for this scenario, especially if it’s a high-involvement product that might require a half an hour call to cover all the bases.

Sometimes they are simply answering a text message and you can offer to wait for them but most of the time you will need to have questions ready to re-engage them in the call.

## Improve the process {#improve-the-process}

Try a different angle, new storyline, address different needs. See what works but always try to improve. You can always find ways to make everything run more efficiently and smoother and CrankWheel has some features that can help you do that.

### Monitor length of sessions {#monitor-length}

For complicated products such as life and health insurance, the salesman needs to cover and go over many different things during the call.

Managers can monitor the length of screen-sharing sessions in CrankWheel to see if their sales team is spending a sufficient amount of time on the calls to go over everything that they are obligated to cover.

The length of sessions can as well relate to the success rate of calls and can be one of the things team leaders use when helping their salespeople to succeed further.

### Screen-sharing as a part of the coaching program {#coaching-program}

As mentioned above, managers can monitor the length of sessions to see if team members might need some guidance.

There are two other features in CrankWheel that can come in handy as well when coaching individual members of the sales team. Managers can jump on live screen sharing sessions to give feedback or view a recording of a session to give pointers on how their team can improve.

## Features that will give your team an edge {#edge}

CrankWheel is not only screen sharing. It includes some other powerful features that will help your team close more and reduce churn rates.

### Use Remote Control in sessions {#remote-control}

The Remote Control feature in CrankWheel enables the presenter to hand control of the session over to the viewer.

This can help during the sales process, especially if the prospect has to fill in forms or log in to a site. While screen sharing gives prospects the opportunity to see when the salesman is entering their information thus double-checking, offering them to do it and guide the process makes the call interactive for the customer.

This feature is used as well in the post-sales process when onboarding new customers and teaching them how to use websites, control panels or admin councils.

Some of the use cases for handing the control over to the customer during screen sharing sessions are obvious from the start but others might reveal themselves after you begin to use CrankWheel. Keep an open mind to see where it might benefit your particular use case.

### Leverage videos in screen sharing sessions {#video}

The Projector feature makes it possible for presenters to show high-quality videos with sound seamlessly during screen sharing sessions. This is a great opportunity to get your brand's audiovisual assets across during a sales call.

With the projector, your sales team can leverage customer testimonial videos or show your current campaigns even on the first cold call.

Only the account's admin can select which videos can be played. That means that agents will only show relevant videos at every given time.

See the guide on how to enable videos here:

[How to enable and project videos to a screen sharing session](https://crankwheel.com/getting-started-screen-sharing-basics/#projector).

### Add instant demos to your channels {#instant-demos}

Looking for hot, qualified leads? The Instant Demo feature of CrankWheel might be just what you need.

A prospect is browsing your website and at a critical point, you have information on how they can reach you. Their next action is critical and your reaction is even more critical.

If you react within the next five minutes, you are up to 22 times more likely to close the sale. Instant Demos is a Call-to-Action widget designed around this scenario.

Prospects click a “Give me a call” button on your website and enters their name and phone number. Your team will see an alert in their CrankWheel extension and the first one to click grabs the inbound lead and can start a screen sharing session within seconds.

You can also direct leads from your social media or newsletter straight to the CrankWheel UI of your sales team. Instead of using the widget, you can use your Instant Demos URL and link it to CTA buttons on your profile or newsletter blasts. If you add UTM codes to the URL, your sales teams can see the source of the campaign when they handle the call.

### Use your own post-session redirect URLs {#postsession}

The post-session redirect happens on the viewers/prospects screen when the agent ends the screen sharing session. Once the session ends, the viewer is redirected to a landing page that is set by the admin of the CrankWheel account. This feature can be used to direct prospects to specific landing pages, depending on the topic of the session. It can also be used to gather reviews or direct viewers to order forms.

**To set the default redirect landing page:**

1. Admin sets the page by going to Configuration -> Company Settings or by [clicking here](https://meeting.is/ss/edit_company).
2. Paste the URL under "Redirect to this webpage after each meeting".
3. Now every session will redirect viewers to that page by default.

**To enable agents to select landing pages during a session:**

1. Admins configure the end of session drop-down URLs by going to the admin dashboard's Configuration -> Collateral in the menu or by [clicking here](https://meeting.is/ss/company_content).
2. Click the Post Session redirect button in the upper right corner.
3. Click the Add Post Session Redirect button.
4. Enter the URL and name it.

**How agents select a post-session URL:**

1. Agents might need to close and relaunch the CrankWheel UI for the new URL to appear in the drop-down menu.
2. During a session, the agent clicks Actions in the lower right corner of the CrankWheel UI and selects a URL from the drop-down menu.
3. If the agent does not select a landing page, the viewer will be redirected to the default landing page.
