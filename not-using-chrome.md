# Not using Chrome?

Sorry, but the CrankWheel software for presenters is currently only compatible
with the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium)
browsers. On the other hand, your viewers do not need to install any software,
ever.

If you use either of those browsers, please run it and type in `crankwheel.com`
before you try installing again.

If you don't want to use those browsers, how about [signing up for our mailing](/sign-up-to-download/)
list to get notified when we add presenter software for other browsers?
