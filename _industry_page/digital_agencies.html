main: "For small and medium businesses, local listings in business directories or
  the Yellow pages were one of the best ways to get noticed by customers looking for
  their exact service.\n\nWith the Internet, consumers turned to search engines to
  find local businesses for their needs. For many businesses, the world has opened
  up but at the same time, so has the risk of getting lost in search results from
  all the information the world has to offer.<br>\n\nCompanies that used to publish
  local listings followed their customers to the modern age and helped them get noticed
  on the Net by becoming digital agencies and experts in digital marketing.\n\nComing
  from the other direction, thousands of digital-first marketing agencies now serve
  the needs of these same small and medium businesses. The market for e-commerce and
  online presence is far from saturated which means that neither is the demand for
  consultants for online solutions.\n\nCompanies with an online presence need to be
  constantly on their toes to keep up with developments and many have fallen behind
  or need guidance, especially small and medium businesses.\n\nGrowth opportunities
  for digital agencies are in the SMB market. The catch is that decision-makers in
  those businesses have to wear many hats. \n\nAnd they are hard to reach to sit down
  for a sales pitch on how they can improve their online marketing efforts. They don’t
  have the time or patience to learn about the difference between SEO, PPC or SERP.\n\nWith
  CrankWheel, Digital Agencies have been able to get around that. During a phone call,
  the prospect is sent a link to their inbox or to their mobile phone. Once they click
  the link, they are instantly shown what customers see on search engines, how it
  can be changed and how their website can be changed by pulling up a draft of an
  improved version.\n\nThere is no need to explain in detail how SEM is the same but
  not the same as SEO - you can just show them. Screen sharing works on any browser
  on any device.\n"

    The convenience and efficiency of a phone call combined with the visual engagement of an in-person meeting.

    During a call, you simply send your customer a link via email or with SMS and they can see what you are sharing in just seconds on any device and with any browser.

    When you need to cover complicated matters, it’s easier to use visual aids and show the customer what you mean.
- title: Co-browsing
  description: |-
    With the screen-sharing functionality of CrankWheel, you can easily share visuals with customers.

    The co-browsing Remote Control feature of CrankWheel is used by Digital Agencies for training staff, onboarding and customer success.

    The agent can start a screen sharing session and can then hand the control over to the viewer on the other and guide them through a process.
- title: Capture inbound leads
  description: |-
    The customer looks at your website and is interested in your offering and wants to know more.

    How do you enable interested customers to engage with you? Do you direct them to sign up to your newsletter, do you let them talk to a bot or is there a phone number buried somewhere near the bottom?

    With Instant demo, you place a clear call to action on your site, urging your customer to receive a call. They click, fill out a simple form and your sales team’s CrankWheel interface instantly alerts them.

    The representative that reacts the quickest can hop on and calls your customer at once. The quicker you engage with interested customers, the higher the close rate.

    With the combination of quick response and screen sharing, you are increasing the chance of closing the sale significantly.
