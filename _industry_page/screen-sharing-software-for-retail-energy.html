main: "With the liberalization of energy markets and disruption in other sectors,
  the energy utility of yesterday has become the energy brand of today. Customers
  expect great customer service. Yet they are skeptical towards providers of an intangible
  yet crucial necessity. \n\nCrankWheel makes it easier for business electricity suppliers
  as well as home electricity providers in the retail energy market to sell and market
  their products and services.\n\nBy adding a visual dimension to phone calls with
  customers, energy companies are able to explain complex matters in just seconds.
  \n\nCustomer engagement for retail electricity suppliers is usually at the beginning
  of the customer relationship and when things go wrong. And it’s usually done over
  the phone. An up-to-date utility makes these touchpoints count with seamless zero
  friction interaction.\n"

    When customer service reps share their screens with the customer, they are more
    likely to give a satisfactory explanation to the customer. '
