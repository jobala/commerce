main: "Adding a visual element to sales calls is a no-brainer. Especially when all
  of your prospects are either sitting by a computer or have a smartphone in their
  hands or in their pockets. \n\nCrankWheel enables you to send a link to your screen-sharing
  session and they can open it on any device and any browser without a problem. You
  will see when they have joined the session, what they are focusing on and if they
  are no longer viewing your presentation. \n\nScreen sharing also provides field
  sales teams with a hybrid alternative that enables them to use their presentation
  skills on the phone and cut down the number of visits to each prospect.\n\n"

    The customer looks at your website and is interested in your offering and wants to know more. How do you enable interested customers to engage with you?

    With Instant demos, you place a clear call to action on your site, urging your customer to request a call. They click, fill out a simple form and your sales team’s CrankWheel interface instantly alerts them.

    The representative that reacts the quickest can hop on and calls your customer at once. The quicker you engage with interested customers, the higher the close rate.

    With the combination of quick response and screen sharing, you are increasing the chance of closing the sale significantly.
