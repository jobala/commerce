  Screen sharing can improve students’ in-classroom experience and is valuable for remote teaching. CrankWheel offers educators to share the contents of their screens from a Windows, macOS or Chromebook environment to any device, any browser. <br>

  One-on-one sessions give presenters the opportunity to see which parts of the shared screen their students are engaging with or focusing on and can instantly see if they are not viewing the shared material.

  Screen sharing comes in handy when helping students to learn how to use applications and the teacher can turn the controls over to the student under supervision.

  CrankWheel is not only useful for remote learning. It can help visually impaired students to view what's being projected on their own devices and screen sharing can come in handy when a projector is not around or broken.

  CrankWheel does not require viewers to install or sign up for anything.

    The Instant Demo feature makes it possible for educators to offer students the possibility to request an appointment during office hours remotely.

    The student clicks a button on a website which opens up a form where they can type in their name and phone number.

    The educator gets alerted instantly and can choose to call back and start a screen-sharing session with the student. The request is logged and the teacher can set up an appointment with the student at a later date.
