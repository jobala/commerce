  With CrankWheel, mortgage advisors can provide their customers the efficiency of a phone call with the visual engagement and interactivity of in-person appointments.

  The agent can instantly share a visual comparison for the customer of the difference between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, calculate live how interest rate hikes would affect their monthly payments, or show the difference between shorter and longer mortgage terms.

  With CrankWheel, the agent can fill out forms in front of the customer or turn control over for the customer to fill in the forms. The agent can also help the customer to fill out the relevant home insurance forms that might be needed for the loan.
